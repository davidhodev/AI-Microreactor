Gaseous flows in microfluidic devices are often characterized by relatively high Knudsen numbers. For such flows, the continuum approximation is not valid, and direct-simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) may be used to find an appropriate solution. For low-velocity flows, where the fluid velocity is much smaller than the mean molecular velocity, large statistical fluctuations in the solution mean that the features of the flow may be obscured by noise in the solution. This paper describes the use of a high-order, nonlinear monotone convection algorithm, flux-corrected transport (FCT), as a filter to extract the solution from the noisy DSMC calculation. We examine the results of filtering a DSMC solution of a noisy low-velocity microchannel flow using both the FCT filter, and a stochastic estimator commonly used to remove noise from noisy sensor measurements. It is shown that FCT filtering removes the high-frequency statistical fluctuations from the noisy DSMC solution, while the stochastic estimator eventually tends toward the wrong solution. Although the application in this paper has been limited to microflows, this filter has significant potential for a wide variety of DSMC problems used in physical regimes where statistical noise must be eliminated. Because it is a postprocessing operation and does not affect the DSMC calculation as it is running, filtering can be applied to any DSMC solution. This includes calculations with complex geometries, the presence of many interacting species with chemical reactions, varied and complicated boundary conditions, and time-dependent solutions.
