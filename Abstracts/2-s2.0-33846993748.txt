The development of advanced microchannel heat exchangers and microfluidic devices is dependent upon the understanding of the fundamental heat transfer processes that occur in these systems. There have been great advancements in our understanding of the heat transfer and fluid flow mechanisms that occur in microchannels. There is several research areas in microchannel heat transfer that so promise for such applications as microprocessor cooling. An enhanced microchannel heat exchanger (EMCHX) that uses single-phase liquid flows has been developed. This EMCHX uses flow obstructions to create a continually developing flow condition and the enhancement in heat transfer associated with that flow regime. A silicon substrate is chosen to create off-set strip fins in the microchannel flow field. Experimental verification of this new method shows excellent improvement in heat transfer over plain or traditional microchannels with straight, continuous walls. However, careful attention must be paid to the added pressure drop that is created by adding these obstructions. A new microchannel parameter called pumping power flux is developed to aid in the comparison between plain and enhanced microchannels. The pumping power flux is used in conjunction with the heat flux to calculate a coefficient of performance to demonstrate the heat transfer enhancement. The enhanced microchannels provide a much higher COP for the same flow conditions. Therefore, the improved heat transfer provided outweighs the added pressure drop caused by the enhanced microchannels. Copyright Â© 2006 by ASME.
