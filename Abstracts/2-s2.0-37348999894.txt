A flow-focusing device with circular cross-section to produce monodispersed air bubbles and foams in several gelatine solutions is presented. Four flow regimes were studied by varying the gas pressure: dripping, bi-disperse bubbly, bubbly and foam flows. Bubble formation at the flow-focusing exit is discussed in detail and compared with that in rectangular microchannels. The bubble volume was shown to depend on the viscosity of the gelatine solution but not on the surface tension. For the bubbly flow, the frequency of bubble formation in this geometry was similar to that found in rectangular microchannels. For the foam flow the frequency was independent of the pressure. Study in the outlet microchannel for the bubbly and foam flows showed that the gas flow followed a power law with the applied pressure. Finally, the viscous resistance was measured and a pressure drop law was determined for each regime. Â© 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
