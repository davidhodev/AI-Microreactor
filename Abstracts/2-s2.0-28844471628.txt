We report on the experimental observation of a spatiotemporal resonance phenomenon, in which a temporal excitation locks with a spatial pattern in an open flow system. The observation is made in a microfluidic system. We obtain the expected regimes-mixing and resonant patterns-in qualitative agreement with the theory. As an application, we realized a dual system particle extraction-micromixer. Â© 2005 The American Physical Society.
