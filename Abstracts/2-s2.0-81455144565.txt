In this work, we report a rich sequence of elastic transitions captured experimentally using a viscoelastic, shear-thinning solution. The experiments were carried out in a microchannel with a sudden contraction followed by a smooth expansion, taking advantage of the distinctive conditions provided by microfluidic viscoelastic flows, i.e the capability of achieving high Deborah numbers (De) while keeping the Reynolds numbers low enough so that inertia does not have a significant impact. We studied the effect of De on the flow patterns and were able to achieve a flow regime, at sufficiently high De, in which the flow becomes unsteady with the main vortices formed upstream of the contraction varying in size substantially and very rapidly resembling what Afonso et al. [1] coined as the back-shedding regime. This process is accompanied by the formation of secondary vortices, which are shed in the upstream flow direction. A similar phenomenon was also captured by our preliminary numerical simulations performed using the Oldroyd-B constitutive equation.
