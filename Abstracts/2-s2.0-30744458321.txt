This paper examines geometric scaling models for field flow fractionation systems to understand how channel dimensions affect resolution and retention. Specifically, the changing contribution of the instrumental plate height during miniaturization of field flow fractionation (FFF) systems is reported. The work is directed towards determining the optimal geometrical parameters for miniaturization of field flow fractionation systems. The experimental relationship between channel height in FFF systems and instrumental plate heights is reported. FFF scaling models are modified to: (i) better clarify the dependence of plate height and resolution on channel height in FFF and (ii) include a more complete geometrical scaling analysis and model comparison in the low retention regime. Electrical field flow fractionation has been shown to benefit from miniaturization, so this paper focuses on that subtype, but surprisingly, the results also indicate the possibility of improvement in performance with miniaturization of other field flow fractionation systems including general FFF subtypes in which the applied field does not vary with channel height. This paper also discusses the potential role of more powerful microscale field flow fractionation systems as a new class of sample preparation units for micro-total-analysis systems (μ-TAS). © 2005 Elsevier B.V.
