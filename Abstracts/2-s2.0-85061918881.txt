Microfluidic platforms have enabled the simplification of biochemical assays with a significant reduction in the use of reagents, yet the current methods available for analyzing reaction products can limit applications of these approaches. This paper demonstrates a simple microfluidic device that incorporates a functionalized self-assembled monolayer to measure the rate constant for a chemical reaction. The device mixes the reactants and allows them to selectively immobilize to the monolayer at the base of a microfluidic channel in a time-dependent manner as they flow down the channel. Imaging self-assembled monolayers for matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (iSAMDI-MS) is used to acquire a quantitative image representing the time-resolved progress of the reaction as it flowed through the channel. Knowledge of the surface immobilization chemistry and the fluid front characteristics allows for the determination of the chemical reaction rate constant. This approach widens the applicability of microfluidics for chemical reaction monitoring and establishes a label-free method for studying processes that occur within a dispersive regime.
