The flow behavior of polymer solutions with relatively high viscosity in a coaxial micro-channel device was investigated. In the experiment, two kinds of flow patterns, dripping and jetting, could be formed. The jetting regime occurred as flow rate and viscosity of the fluids increased. The influence of two-phase viscosities and flow rates on drop size was investigated. The results could be used to guide the preparation of polymer micro-sized spheres. Mathematic models for predicting drop size in two flow patterns were established separately, and the calculated values fitted experimental results well. Â© All Rights Reserved.
