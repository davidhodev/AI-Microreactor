The design of novel food micro-structures aimed at the quality, health and pleasure markets will probably require unit operations where the scale of the forming device is closer to the size of the structural elements (i.e., 1-100 μm). One emerging possibility is microfluidics or devices that employ small amounts of fluids (10 -6 to 10 -9 l) flowing in channels where at least one dimension is less than 1 mm. However, under these conditions, the predominant effects are not necessarily those present in conventional macroscopic unit operations. Dominant physical effects at the microfluidic scale are introduced through the use of dimensionless numbers. Different types of geometries to generate multi-phase flows in micro-channels, techniques and materials to construct the micro-devices, principally soft lithography and laser ablation, as well as methods used to modify surface properties of channels, are reviewed. The operation of micro-devices, the role of flow regimes, rheological behaviour of fluids in micro-channels and of transient time is discussed. Finally, systems developed to generate emulsions and foams, fluid mixing and dispersion, and future applications of these devices in food processing and food analysis are presented. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.
