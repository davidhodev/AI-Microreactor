This paper presents an analysis of double emulsion formation through a cross junctional flow-focusing microchannel which uses an improved color gradient lattice Boltzmann method. The model with the potential to simulate a ternary system of immiscible fluids was employed. Two double emulsion formation regimes, one-step and two-step, were simulated. The effect of the inner flow rate, as well as inner and outer flow viscosity was investigated on double emulsion formation. The inner flow rate had a significant influence on the inner liquid jet detachment point in the two-step process. However, the viscosity of the inner and outer fluid considerably affected the double jet detachment point in the one-step formation. The shell thickness of a double emulsion can be adjusted by altering the inner flow rate.
