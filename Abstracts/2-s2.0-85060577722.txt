© 2019 American Chemical Society.The fabrication of a new copper-functionalized lignocellulosic microreactor (Cu-LμR) from bamboo culms is herein described together with its operation to perform a copper(I)-catalyzed 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition between azide and terminal alkyne (CuAAC). The bio-microfluidic device showed an easy prototyping and fast functionalization with copper ions. All reactions were carried out in flow regime with aqueous-methanol solvent and minimal leaching of copper, yielding a series of model 1,4-disubstitued triazole derivatives with good efficiency in a low-resource setting.
