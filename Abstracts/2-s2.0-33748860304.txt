Inorganic and organic integrated systems detect, process, and respond to signals from solid media. Advances in fluidic systems have offered an alternative to traditional signaling methods through the development of aqueous signaling systems. Here, we show an experimentally simple mechanically governed fluidic system that creates three-dimensional molecular multiphase separation in a combination of discrete and continuous gradients analogous to digital and analog signals that can be used for controlled spatiotemporal cellular stimulation. We accomplish the pattern formation by fabricating a compartmentalized multi-level fluidics device where a network of capillaries converges into a main channel. Simultaneous control of the fluid streams in the horizontal and vertical planes allows us to create hybrid aqueous patterns. This soft lithography system enables controlled diffusion schemes within the laminar flow regime in three dimensions and overcomes the limitations of monophasic delivery and planar constraints. Our fluidic device has potential applications in a wide range of systems from three-dimensional biological control in cell structure and motility studies to fluidic computational devices.
