Droplet-based microfluidics became a powerful tool for quantitative high-throughput analysis of molecular and biological interactions. Gradient dosing can be applied for the generation of large sample collections with systematic variation in the concentration of the ingredients and effectors. Droplets can be incubated in capillary systems preserving their order. In this serial regime the concentration pattern in each droplet can be recalculated from its number, it's creation time and the gradient dosing program, used for the generation of the droplet collection. Up to now, saw-fish-tooth like concentration gradients are widely used for this purpose. In our work we investigate the potential of periodic sinusoidal gradients for this type of screening applications. Due to their periodicity and continuity it is expected, that these types of gradients improve reliability in the gradient generation process due to the lack of discontinuities in the flow rates. On the other hand the key features of these gradients in terms of continuity and periodicity allow improvements in data analysis and error detection to gain more accurate analytical results. This initial hypothesis is proved in droplet-based experiments for the measurement of the minimum inhibitory concentration of the antibiotic Ciprofloxacin to bacterial strain E. coli RV308.
