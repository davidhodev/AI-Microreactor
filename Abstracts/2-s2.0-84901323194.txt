In a Knudsen pump, gas flows from the cold side to the hot side when a temperature gradient is established. For the pump to operate, the gas channels must be small such that the flow regime is transitional or free molecular. In this paper, a model for a thermoelectric based Knudsen pump is presented. The thermoelectric element, which is nanoporous, serves as a generator for the temperature gradient and as a medium for gas flow. Equations for the maximum mass flow rate and maximum pressure were obtained, which can be used to optimize a Knudsen pump. Using the model, the authors found that the higher the thermoelectric figure of merit Z, the higher the generated pressure and mass flow rate. The maximum pressure is independent of the thermoelectric dimensions, which makes it readily integrated into many applications such as lab-on-a chip, microelectromechanical systems, and microfluidic devices.
