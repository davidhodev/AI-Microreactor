All right reserved.Simulation of co-flowing behavior in a coaxial geometry (based on the designed spin pack) has been performed using properties of two immiscible liquids to represent flowing regime while passing through the spinneret for production of liquid core fiber (LCF) by one single step high-speed melt-spinning process. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations confirmed the continuous liquid core channel, obtained in bicomponent melt-spinning of LCF. Also different interface morphologies could be observed: from jetting to dripping and transition core-annular regime, based on the simulation parameters, affecting the driving forces. Results showed different co-flow regimes by systematic variation in nondimensional parameters (flow rate ratio, viscosity ratio, Reynolds number, Weber number and Capillary number), individually. Also diameter of the core liquid is reduced in a logarithmic mode by increasing the outer liquid’s flow rate. Flowing morphologies at different conditions were plotted in 2D state diagrams, illustrating transition from dripping to jetting regime by changing two different parameters. This CFD analysis bears potential for simple ways of controlled jet breakup in microfluidic devices, which currently primarily rely on Rayleigh-Taylor breakup. Notably this work highlights the melt-flow regime in the spinneret to realize developed fiber core structures at different conditions during bicomponent melt-spinning. Using various materials with different properties in liquid core fiber production promises many applications for this new generation fiber in very near future.
