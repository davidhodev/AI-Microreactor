Using microscopic particle image velocimetry, we examine the flow field around an oil droplet as it is formed by hydrodynamic focusing in an aqueous solution using a pressure-driven cross-channel microfluidic device. By detecting the temporal dependence of the instantaneous flow fields of the continuous phase in the dripping regime, we show that shear is not the primary mechanism that initiates droplet formation in our low flow rate and moderate capillary number experimental conditions. Instead, the advancing finger of oil partially and temporarily plugs the outlet channel, creating a pressure difference that builds up and is released when water from the side channels pushes the tip of the finger into the outlet channel, thereby facilitating the birth of the droplet by interfacial pinch-off that is primarily initiated by an extensional flow.
