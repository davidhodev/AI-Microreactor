© 2019 Elsevier B.V.We demonstrate, for the first time, the application of FTIR spectroscopic imaging approach in situ to monitor the precipitation process of oil asphaltenes, induced by n-heptane under flow using microfluidic devices. The aggregation of asphaltenes induced by n-heptane flow with subsequent precipitation and formation of the deposits was studied for solution containing 5 wt % of asphaltenes in benzene. The FTIR spectroscopic approach with an array detector allowed us to assess the spatial distribution of the chemical components and their amounts in the system and display the process of aggregates formation with a spatial resolution of few micrometres. This chemical imaging technique shows that the flow of heptane results in non-equilibrium condition when the local content of the flocculants reaches the threshold amount needed for the asphaltenes aggregation. The relatively slow process of heptane diffusion into the benzene induces the asphaltenes aggregation followed by their precipitation and compaction. Fast asphaltene aggregation process under heptane flow leads to the formation of the deposit firmly fixed to the surface, while the precipitates formed during the diffusion process of heptane into the benzene can be easily taken from the channel. The FTIR spectroscopic imaging of the deposits formed revealed the spatial inhomogeneity of the precipitated asphaltenes in the direction of the heptane flow in microfluidic channel which is reflected in their different chemical composition and the presence of different functional groups (CH2–CH3, C[dbnd]O, S[dbnd]O). In particular, it was found that asphaltenes of different types and different CH2/CH3 ratios gradually start to precipitate in the direction of n-heptane flow. The data obtained demonstrate the importance of local concentration of flocculants as well as local characteristics of the system for asphaltenes aggregation, and overall precipitation process in flow regime.
