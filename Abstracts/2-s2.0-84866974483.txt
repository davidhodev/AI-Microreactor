During the last two decades, most of the studies on microchannels shows deviations with respect to traditional laws as unusual friction factors or shifts in the transition between laminar and turbulent flow. Our study consists in characterizing the dynamic field and heat transfer aspect of a flow in smooth, circular minichannels using a commercial code CFX 5.7.1. This code use the finite volume method to solve the equations of Navier-Stokes and offer several turbulences models. In this study, the shear stress turbulence model (SST) is used. The results obtained are rich in information. In addition to the results from the theory, established for the traditional pipes, we have experimental results obtained for a minichannel of size similar to those of our study. The validation of our calculations is thus made by a comparison with experimental measurements (Reynaud) and theoretical values. A good agreement is observed. Note however, that a light deviation is observed concerning the transition zone between laminar and turbulent regime. This zone seems to be located for values of Reynolds number going from 1000 and 5000. This result was confirmed by many researchers working in the field of the mini and microfluidics. These values show that the transition zone is more precisely pointed, than the classical theory predicted it. The results of this study are not likely to give in cause validity of the traditional laws in the case of the mini-channels until a diameter of 0.1mm. We showed that deviations are observed compared to the traditional correlations, but generally, a good agreement is noted.
