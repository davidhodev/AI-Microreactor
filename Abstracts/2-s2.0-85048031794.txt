The effective pressure domain of use of the microchips are compared for two chemical systems. After studying the flow patterns and current empirical equations proposed in the literature, a new empirical equation is validated for both T and X-junctions allowing the prediction of not only the domain of use of the microchip in terms of flow rates knowing the viscosities of the two phases but also the droplets diameter, volume, spacing, and specific interfacial area. Specific interfacial area could be optimized using the model within our specific microsystems, and a maximum of 10,000 m−1 is determined. Ensuing the definition of the model, several insights in the way to optimize segmented flows for different purposes are discussed, i.e., for the production of monodisperse populations of droplets and mass transfer optimization.
