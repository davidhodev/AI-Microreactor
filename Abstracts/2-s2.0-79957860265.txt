The complex flow behaviour of semi-dilute (15<c/c<22.5) polydisperse polyethylene oxide (PEO) aqueous solutions flowing through a planar microfluidic geometry with an 8:1:8 contraction-expansion is systematically studied. The molecular weight and distribution of the PEO samples are analysed by Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC). Full rheometric characterizations using various techniques including piezoelectric axial vibrator (PAV) measurements at frequencies as high as 6700Hz are carried out for one semi-dilute PEO solution. Complex flows over a wide range of elasticity numbers (20≤El≤120), Weissenberg numbers (7≤Wi≤121) and Reynolds numbers (0.08≤Re≤4.5) are characterized using micro-particle image velocimetry (μ-PIV) and pressure drop measurements. The evolution of vortex formation and dynamics has been visualized through a step-flow-rate experiment. The effect of El on vortex stability has been studied. Various flow dynamics regimes have been quantified and are presented in a Wi-Re diagram. The experimental results reveal that the elastic behaviour of polymer solutions is very sensitive to high molecular weight polymer in the polydisperse polymer samples, and the contraction ratio and the aspect ratio of flow geometry are the important design parameters in controlling the non-linear dynamics of semi-dilute polymer solutions in microfluidics. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.
