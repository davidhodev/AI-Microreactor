© 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.We report fabrication of stable ZnS nanoparticles (NPs) using a green chemistry concept with watermelon rind extract as capping and stabilizing agent. The cubic structure of the NPs was evidenced by X-ray powder diffraction analysis and electron diffraction studies. Dynamic light scattering and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy studies revealed that the average size of the ZnS NPs was <12 nm. The bandgap of the ZnS nanocrystals was found to be 3.42 eV using ultraviolet–visible (UV–Vis) spectroscopy studies. The energy-dispersive X-ray spectrum of the fabricated ZnS NPs confirmed the elemental Zn and S signals without peaks from any impurities. The biomolecular capping of the ZnS NPs was analyzed using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. An illustrative stabilization mechanism for the ZnS NPs is given using citrulline, a major phytochemical in watermelon rind extract. The obtained ZnS NPs showed good photocatalytic activity towards methylene blue dye degradation.
