Forty one genotypes of seed purpose watermelon were evaluated under rainfed conditions of Jaisalmer for their seed yield stability during kharif 2011 to 2013. Among the genotypes variability was fairly conspicuous for seed size, shape, color and seed distribution pattern inside the fruit flesh. Number of fruits, fruit yield and seed yield per plant exhibited high heritability coupled with high genetic advance as per cent of mean. The analysis of variance showed significant differences among the genotypes and environments for seed yield and other contributory traits. Four genotypes viz., SKNK-683, SKNK-112, SKGPK-26 and SKGPK-30 remained stable over seasons, meanwhile genotypes viz., DRB-675, DRB-677, SKNK-665, SKNK-679, SKNK-903, SKGPK-22, SKGPK-24, SKGPK-31 and SPS-8 performed better in good rainfall year. These genotypes can be used in further breeding programs for development of high seed yield genotypes of watermelon for different situations of hot arid zone.
