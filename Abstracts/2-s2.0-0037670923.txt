The in-plane digital sorting of the multiphase microfluid flow is presented in the laminar flow regime. It is achieved by manipulating the pitch of alternate microfluid flow and delay distance resulting from passing through special microchannels. The theoretical analysis derives delay distance. For experimental evaluation, a characteristic in-plane microchannel is fabricated by using micromachining. The pitch of the alternate microfluid flow is controlled. Digital sorting is demonstrated by using the immiscible droplet phase fluids. Also, the dynamic behavior of the droplet phase microfluids is measured by the particle image velocimetry (micro-PIV) and characterized qualitatively and qualitatively.
