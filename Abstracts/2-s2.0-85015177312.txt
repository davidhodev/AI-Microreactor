Â© 2017 American Chemical Society.In this paper, we present a dynamic microfluidic tensiometer able to perform measurements over more than four decades and which is suitable for high throughput experimentations. This tensiometer is able to withstand hard conditions such as high pressure, high temperature, high salinity, and crude oil. It is made of two coaxial capillaries in which two immiscible fluids are injected. Depending on the flow rate of each phase, either droplets or jetting will be obtained. The transition between these two regimes relies on the Rayleigh-Plateau instability. This transition can be theoretically computed thanks to a linear analysis based on the convective and absolute instabilities theory. From this model, the interfacial tension between the two phases can be calculated.
