An advection–diffusion–reaction transport model for a continuous reactor characterized by a simple geometry is simulated to provide a design guidance for the realization of an optimized experimental prototype consisting of a rectangular channel hosting a scaffold slab that provides an immobilizing support for the cells. A counter-current carrier flow crossing the channel feeds the oxygen and growth factors and ensures the removal of metabolic products. A more complex sinusoidal configuration, which has been recently used as for hepatocyte culture, is proposed and evaluated. Silico tests shows how the designed device is able to replicate the endothelial–parenchymal interface of a liver sinusoid.
