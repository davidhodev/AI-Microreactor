There are currently several techniques available for assessing cell deformability. However, two techniques dominate hemorheological research in the single cell flow regime, namely, micropipette aspiration and filtration. A microfluidic device has been developed which can function either as an array of micropipettes or a two dimensional filter matrix. This device is useful for providing steady state analysis of flowing cells.
