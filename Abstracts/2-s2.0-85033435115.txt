A C8-and-amino-bifunctionalized ordered mesoporous organosilica (C8-AMS) was prepared in a deep eutectic solvent—a green solvent—that was used as the reaction medium for this procedure instead of organic solvents or other catalyst for the first time. This method provided a nontoxic way for C8 grafting and obtaining an ordered mesoporous organosilica material with both hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups. Besides advantages such as its large surface area, regular and uniform pore size, and hydrothermal stability, the obtained bifunctionalized C8-AMS also have two main functional groups in the obtained structure, C8 and amino, which enriched the adsorption mechanism of the material and as a result improved the adsorption selectivity of C8-AMS. Its performance as an adsorbent was estimated in extracting trace triazine herbicides from watermelon using solid-phase extraction (SPE) followed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The proposed method provided satisfactory features in terms of linearity (0.01–2.00 μg g−1), limits of detection (2.9–5.1 ng g−1), accuracy (recovery: 85.7–101.7%), and precision (intra-day and inter-day RSDs: 1.68–2.60% and 3.05–4.01%).
