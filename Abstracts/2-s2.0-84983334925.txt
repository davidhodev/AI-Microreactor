Â© 15CBMS-0001. The traditional fabrication technique used in microfluidics, i.e. soft-lithography, is complex and expensive for fabricating three-dimensional (3D) structures. Recently a handful of studies have demonstrated droplet production through 3D-printed microfluidic devices. However, these devices invariably use two-dimensional (2D) flow structures. Herein we apply 3D printing technology to fabricate simple and low-cost 3D microfluidic devices for emulsion generation without need for surface treatment of the channel walls. We formulate uniform scaling laws for emulsion drops generated in different regimes, by incorporating the dynamic contact angle effects during the drop formation. Magnetically responsive microspheres are also produced based on emulsion templates.
