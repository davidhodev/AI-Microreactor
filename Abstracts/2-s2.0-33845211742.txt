Microfluidic technology has recently been applied to the formation of controlled particulate structures, such as emulsion droplets, foams, encapsulates and gel particles. While these types of particles are typical of many foodstuffs, production of foods with microfluidics is not really possible, due to the low throughput of typical microfluidic devices, as well as the general use of model materials. Here we present Microfluidic technology applied to the production of monodisperse emulsion using food ingredients. In particular, we investigate the effect of surfactants and microdevice geometry on drop size and robust production regimes. The asymptotic minimum drop size is bigger in flow focusing geometries than in Psi and Pi junction geometries, decreasing with the addition of surfactant. Several production patterns were identified and only one of which is useful to produce monodispersed emulsion. The influence of surfactant is noted as the boundaries between the various production regions vary.
