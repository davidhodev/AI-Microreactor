Burning behavior of small-scale wood crib was studied by a serial of cone calorimeter tests. The heat release rate curves of these small wood cribs were different due to porosity factor and this shows that the control condition switches from one to another. The burning of some crib with small porosity factors was self-extinguished in fixed flow rate of air supply in cone calorimeter. These results were compared with Gross's studies. The switch point of porosity-controlled and surface area controlled burning regime is different from Gross's result. Â© 2007 Springer Science+Business Media LLC.
