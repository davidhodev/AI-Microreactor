The behavior of an immiscible binary AB fluid flowing through a three-dimensional chemically patterned microchannel was investigated using computer simulations. The microchannel was decorated with chemically distinct patterns on the top and bottom substrates of the channel. Results showed that in the intermediate velocity regime, a coupling between thermodynamic interactions and the imposed flow field gave rise to a rich interfacial behavior between the A and B fluids.
