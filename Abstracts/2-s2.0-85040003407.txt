Traditionally no-slip and temperature-jump conditions in fluid mechanics are modelled using a linear first order mathematical model to incorporate the tangential momentum accommodation coefficient (TMAC) at a fluid-solid interface, however this formulation is only generally accurate at macroscopic length scales and pressures for Knudsen numbers in which the dominant flow regime is such that the continuum assumption is valid. In this paper we consider the application of a nonlinear slip model for the specification of the boundary conditions in the extended Navier-Stokes system of PDEâ€™s. A numerical discretization scheme is developed for a 2D Couette-Poiseuille problem to simulate microfluidic flow in the interface gap of a piston-cylinder pressure balance with application to an absolute pressure primary scientific standard.
