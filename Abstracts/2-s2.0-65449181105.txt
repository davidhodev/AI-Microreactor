Flow regimes obtained as a consequence of two immiscible fluids interacting at a T-junction are presented for high Capillary numbers and different flow rates of the continuous and dispersed phases. Through lattice Boltzmann based simulations, a regime map is created that distinguishes parallel flows from droplet flows. Simulations show the dependence of flow rates and viscosity ratio on the volume of droplets formed, which is compared with existing experimental data. At high Capillary numbers, the transition zone which separates parallel and droplet flows shrinks, and is influenced by the viscosity ratio as well. Â© 2009 American Institute of Physics.
