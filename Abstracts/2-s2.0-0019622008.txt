Presented is an analytical description of the rapid two dimensional shearing flow of granular materials which results in expressions for the normal as well as the shear stress in terms of various flow parameters. The rapid flow regime here is in accord with the grain-inertia-dominated flow of granular materials as described by Bagnold. Both gradients of velocity and microrotation of grains are taken into account and the final constitutive equations resemble those of a non-Newtonian microfluid for which the stresses depend on the square of the velocity gradients, the square of microrotation gradients, as well as the product of velocity gradients and microrotation gradients.
