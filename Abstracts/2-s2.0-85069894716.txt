Â© 2019 Author(s).Deterministic lateral displacement (DLD) microfluidic devices promise versatile and precise processing of biological samples. However, this prospect has been realized so far only for rigid spherical particles and remains limited for biological cells due to the complexity of cell dynamics and deformation in microfluidic flow. We employ mesoscopic hydrodynamics simulations of red blood cells (RBCs) in DLD devices with circular posts to better understand the interplay between cell behavior in complex microfluidic flow and sorting capabilities of such devices. We construct a mode diagram of RBC behavior (e.g., displacement, zig-zagging, and intermediate modes) and identify several regimes of RBC dynamics (e.g., tumbling, tank-treading, and trilobe motion). Furthermore, we link the complex interaction dynamics of RBCs with the post to their effective cell size and discuss relevant physical mechanisms governing the dynamic cell states. In conclusion, sorting of RBCs in DLD devices based on their shear elasticity is, in general, possible but requires fine-tuning of flow conditions to targeted mechanical properties of the RBCs.
