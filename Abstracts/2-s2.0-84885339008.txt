In microchannel, the pressure drop of liquid-liquid two-phase flow is of vital importance for intensifying heat and mass transfer of the flow system. In the present work, liquid-liquid two-phase flow in rectangular microchannels with two different aspect ratios (400 μm×600 μm and 400μm×800 μm) was recorded by using a high-speed camera, and the pressure drop under slug flow regime was measured by using a differential pressure sensor. The cyclohexane was used as the dispersed phase and distilled water with 0.3% SDS(sodium lauryl sulfate) as the continuous phase. The results show that the pressure drop increases with the increases of the flow rates of both phases, the capillary number Ca, the Reynolds number Re and the viscosity of the continuous phase, and decreases with the increase of the velocity ratio of both phases. When Ca > 0.015 or Re > 20, the pressure drop increases with the increase of the aspect ratio of the microchannel. A modified correlation for homogeneous flow model was proposed for predicting pressure drop under slug flow regime of liquid-liquid two-phase flow in microchannels, and the calculated results show good conformity to the experimental data.
