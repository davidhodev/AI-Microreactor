Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V. It is important to classify the transportation, storage and sale of fruits according to the quality. But it is hard to detect the internal quality of watermelon and other big-sized and thick-skinned fruits with non-destructive means. Although non-destructive detection means of watermelon internal quality has been studied by many researchers, there are still few studies on the on-line detection equipment. Therefore, this paper reviews the recent progress of such type of research and summarizes the main techniques and methods for the detection of watermelon quality. What's more, it also analyzes the strengths and limitations in the application of the technique and introduces the status of the commercial on-line equipment and production line based on the existing technology. The direction in future is to develop portable and on-line detection equipment with multi-information fusion technology. This paper aims to enhance the manufacture of detecting equipment for the fruit quality.
