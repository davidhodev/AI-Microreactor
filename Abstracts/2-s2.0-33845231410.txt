Detailed computational microfluidics flow simulations have been performed to study the effect of two-phase flow regime on heat transfer in small pipes. We essentially show that only with interface tracking methods such as the Level Set employed here can the coupled heat-fluid flow problems well predicted, with detailed information about the physics of the transfer in tube confines. Overall the heat removal rate in two-phase flow is higher than in single phase. Subtle differences in thermal removal rates are revealed when flow-regime transition is triggered from bubbly to slug configuration.
