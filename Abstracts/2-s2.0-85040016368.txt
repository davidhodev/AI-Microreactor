© 2018 Elsevier B.V. Dynamics of water-high-viscosity ionic liquid ([BMIM][PF 6 ]) two-phase flow in a flow-focusing device were investigated by using a high-speed digital camera. Four flow regimes were identified: dripping, jetting, irregular and string of sausages. The rupture of the dispersed thread could be divided into the squeezing and the pinch-off stages. The complex wavy interfacial phenomena – string of sausages were observed and highlighted. The size of the droplet and sausage were predicted respectively by a power-law function with the flow rate ratio and the capillary number.
