Modeling the flow of one-dimensional trains of monodisperse drops impacting a micro-obstacle, we show numerically that complex dynamics may arise through drop-to-drop hydrodynamic interactions: we observe sequences of breakup events in which the size of the daughter drops created upon breaking mother ones becomes a periodic function of time. We demonstrate the existence of numerous bifurcations between periodic breakup regimes and we establish diagrams mapping the possible breakup dynamics as a function of the governing (physicochemical, hydrodynamic, and geometric) parameters. Microfluidic experiments validate our model as they concur very well with predictions.
