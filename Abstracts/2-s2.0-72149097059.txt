The separation of red blood cells from plasma flowing in microchannels is possible by biophysical effects such as the Zweifach-Fung bifurcation law. In the present study, daughter channels are placed alongside a main channel such that cells and plasma are collected separately. The device is aimed to be a versatile but yet very simple module producing high-speed and high-efficiency plasma separation. The resulting lab-on-a-chip is manufactured using biocompatible materials. Purity efficiency is measured for mussel and human blood suspensions as different parameters, such as flow rate and geometries of the parent and daughter channels are varied. The issues of blood plasma separation at the microscale are discussed in relation to the different regimes of flow. Results are compared with those obtained by other researchers in the field of micro-separation of blood. Â© 2009 Springer-Verlag.
