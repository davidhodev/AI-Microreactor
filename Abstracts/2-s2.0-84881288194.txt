Viscoelastic surfactant-laden droplets were generated in silicone oil using a microfluidic T-junction channel device and the droplets dynamics was studied. Surfactant can greatly lower the interfacial tension between the continuous phase fluid and the dispersed phase fluid, and also introduces elasticity to the aqueous solution. The droplets in the confined microchannel experience a steady shear by the continuous phase flow, showing distinct morphological evolvement from those under normal magnitude of interfacial tension and Newtonian fluid nature. It is found that under very low interfacial tension droplet fragmentation (or tail streaming) composing of tiny satellites occurs at the rear of droplet (or upstream of droplet). The production of tails seems to depend on the combination of the capillary number (Ca), flow rate ratio and fluid elasticity (described by Weissenberg number, Wi). This phenomenon demonstrates a new flow regime for aqueous micro-droplets which covered by mobilized, soluble surfactant, indicating such a tail streaming concerns not only the fluid dynamical process, but the properties of the dispersed phase fluid.
