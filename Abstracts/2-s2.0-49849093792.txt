The Navier-Stokes- Fourier equations, with boundary conditions that account for the effects of velocity-slip and temperature-jump, are compared to the direct simulation Monte Carlo method for the case of a lid-driven micro-cavity. Results are presented for Knudsen numbers within the slipflow regime where the onset of nonequilibrium effects are usually observed. Good agreement is found in predicting the general features of the velocity field and the recirculating flow. However, although the steady-state pressure distributions along the walls of the driven cavity are generally in good agreement with the Monte Carlo data, there is some indication that the results are starting to show noticeable differences, particularly at the separation and reattachment points. The modified Navier-Stokes-Fourier equations consistently overpredict the maximum and minimum pressure values throughout the slip regime. This highlights the need for alternative boundary formulations or modeling techniques that can provide accurate and computationally economic solutions over a wider range of Knudsen numbers.
