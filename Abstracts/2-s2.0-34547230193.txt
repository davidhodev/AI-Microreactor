The Lattice Boltzmann simulation of a flow generated by an oscillating plate is conducted in a wide range of frequency variation 0 < ωτ < ∞. The theoretically predicted transition from the viscoelastic (ωτ ≪ 1) Newtonian behavior to purely elastic non-Newtonian regime (ωτ ≫ 1) has been demonstrated. The relation of the derived solutions to microfluidics (high-frequency micro-resonators) is shown on an example of a "plane oscillator". © World Scientific Publishing Company.
