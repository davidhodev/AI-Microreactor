This study addresses micromixer behavior subject to electroconvection occurring near a nanoporous membrane in-situ fabricated by a laser polymerization technique on a microfluidic chip. We found that the micromixer behavior can be categorized into three regimes. Briefly, the weak electroconvection regime is characterized by weak mixing performance at a low applied voltage and KCl concentration, whereas the strong electroconvection regime has a high mixing performance when the applied voltage and KCl concentration are moderately high. Finally, the incomplete electroconvection regime has an incomplete electric double-layer overlap in the nanopores of the membrane when the electrolyte concentration is very high. The mixing index reached 0.92 in the strong electroconvection regime. The detailed fabrication methods for the micromixer and characterization results are discussed in this paper.
