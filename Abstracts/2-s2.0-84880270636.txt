In order to offer the ability of smaller volumes and high throughput in Lab-On-a-Chip and micro Total Analysis Systems devices, more miniaturized components are needed. Due to a low Reynolds number on the microscale, the mixing process can be particularly troublesome. This problem is compounded by the fact that more miniaturization can be challenging in a microfluidic system. In such a case, electroosmotic (EO) force is an efficient force to perturb low Reynolds number fluid. In this paper, a novel Micro-Electro-Mechanical-Systems (MEMS) based fabrication for microfluidic devices, and a more miniaturized micromixer are presented. The proposed technology process requires the covering of excited electrode patterns by a thin Silicon-Nitride (Si3N 4) insulator layer. Fabrication parameters such as Low Pressure Chemical Vapor Deposition (LPCVD) Si3N4 deposition effect, and height of the Phosphor Silicate Glass (PSG) sacrificial layer were investigated for the electroosmotically-driven mixer. Particle tracing for fluid flow was illustrated, the particles were stretched and folded for a long time, which was a proof of chaotic regime. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) revealed that the mixer with covered electrodes provides the high mixing efficiency of above 90% for a 96 μm long microchannel. Using a silicon nitride insulator layer reduces high electric field gradient at sharp corners and edges of the electrodes, leading to the elimination of unwanted electrolyte effects. Thus, the excitation and geometrical parameters were optimized for the micromixer. © 2013 The Korean Society for Biotechnology and Bioengineering and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.
