Many current chemical, medical and pharmaceutical applications require precise measurement of fluidic flow in microfluidic regime where traditional flow metrology standards are obsolete or unavailable. It is often mandatory on the other hand for the flow metrology agency to provide certifications of any possible products in services. In this paper we present a systematic study from liquid from below 150μL/sec in the flow channels smaller than 800μm in diameter. The transportation, pressure, composition, temperature and other ambient effects are measured for the metrological effects. MEMS flow sensing technology with thermal time-of-flight operation mode and calorimetric mode is used as the benchmark to test various flow metrology standard methodology (e.g. gravimetrical, optical, and vibrational) such that a fast calibration metrology standard could be established to certify the available products on markets.
