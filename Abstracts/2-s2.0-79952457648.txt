A microfluidic system, fully operational for further studies of foraging abilities of marine microorganisms, is presented. The microchannels are fabricated in PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane) by a simple, fast and low-cost soft lithography method, utilizing a SU-8 photoresist master. The devices exhibit a quite satisfactory performance, since we obtain the expected laminar flow regime. No leakage was observed in the channel itself and the appropriate flow control was attained. This allows to reproduce, in controlled and realistic conditions, resource patches existing in the ocean at submillimetric scales. Â©The Electrochemical Society.
