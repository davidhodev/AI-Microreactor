Aqueous solutions of polyacrylamide (PAAm) are used as power-law liquids. Influences of PAAm concentration, gas–liquid velocities, and surface tension on bubble characteristics are explored. Various mechanisms of bubble breakup are observed in different concentration of PAAm. Based on the bubble length with respect to the channel diameter, two different flow regimes are identified. Flow pattern maps are constructed based on inlet velocities, and scaling laws are proposed to estimate the bubble length.
