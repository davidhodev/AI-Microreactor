Microband arrays improve the analytical performance and information content of electrochemical detection in flow channel relative to single-electrode configurations. However, exploiting their full advantages requires a detailed understanding of the properties of arrays, which depend on their geometry and on the hydrodynamic regimes established inside the microfluidic channel. This paper investigates the influence of two main operating situations (sequential and coupling regimes) on steady-state amperometric responses of microband arrays performing under laminar flow conditions. Simulations and experimental measurements showed that the resulting properties of the arrays are a function of the number of electrodes and average ratio between gaps and electrode widths, whether the layout of the arrays is regular or not. Since the contribution of each electrode can be finely tailored, this allows the arrays to be designed and adapted to a wide variety of experimental demands. Â© 2010 American Chemical Society.
