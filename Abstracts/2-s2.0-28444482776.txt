This paper describes the fabrication, packaging and characterization of novel multilayer polymer microfluidic systems fabricated by a CMOS compatible process. These microfluidic devices were specially designed for BioMOEMS applications. Embedded multilayer rectangular smooth and uniform microchannels, 50 to 150 μm wide and 18μm deep were studied. Steady-state flow rates and pressure driven flow control were measured in the laminar flow regime. Flow rates ranging from 1 to 100 μl/min, at pressure drop ranging from 10 to 600 kPa, were obtained. These flow rates yield Reynolds numbers (Re) up to 20. Results indicate that the experimental Re and the flow friction coefficient (f) are in good agreement with the laminar flow theory. These experimental results facilitate the future designs of different microfluidic devices designed by using classical fluidic theory. We also present two different methods developed for macro/microfluidic packaging in order to connect these microfluidic devices to the macroscopic world. The microsystem packaging can withstand pressure drops up from 500 to 2000 kPa with any liquid leakage.
