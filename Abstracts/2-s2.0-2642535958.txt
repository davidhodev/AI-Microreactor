Enhancing the species mixing in microfluidic applications is key to reducing analysis time and increasing device portability. The mixing in electroosmotic flow is usually diffusion-dominated. Recent numerical studies have indicated that the introduction of electrically charged surface heterogeneities may augment mixing efficiencies by creating localized regions of flow circulation. In this study, we experimentally visualized the effects of surface charge patterning and developed an optimized electrokinetic micromixer applicable to the low Reynolds number regime. Using the optimized micromixer, mixing efficiencies were improved between 22 and 68% for the applied potentials ranging from 70 to 555 V/cm when compared with the negatively charged homogeneous case. For producing a 95% mixture, this equates to a potential decrease in the required mixing channel length of up to 88% for flows with PÃ©clet numbers between 190 and 1500.
