We study the production and motion of monodisperse double emulsions in microfluidics comprising series co-flow capillaries. Both two and three dimensional simulations are performed. Flow was determined by dimensionless parameters, i.e., Reynolds number and Weber number of continuous and dispersed phases. The co-flow generated droplets are sensitive to the Reynolds number and Weber number of the continuous phase, but insensitive to those of the disperse phase. Because the inner and outer drops are generate by separate co-flow processes, sizes of both inner and outer drops can be controlled by adjusting Re and We for the continuous phase. Meanwhile, the disperse phase has little effect on drop size, thus a desirable generation frequency of inner drop can be reached by merely adjusting flow rate of the inner fluid, leading to desirable ,number of inner drops encapsulated by the outer drop. Thus highly monodisperse double emulsions are obtained. It was found that only in dripping mode can droplet be of high monodispersity. Flow begins to transit from dripping regime to jetting regime when the Re number is decreased or Weber number is increased. To ensure that all the droplets are produced over a wide range of running parameters, tiny tapered tip outlet for the disperse flow should be applied. Smaller the tapered tip, wider range for Re and we can apply. Copyright Â© 2009 by ASME.
