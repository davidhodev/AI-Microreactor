The present work is related to the study of the pressure driven isothermal gas flows through different microchannel configurations such as short straight micro-channels, 900 bend channels and T-shaped junctions. The direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method is used to calculate the gas flow through channel configurations in order to distinguish the flow regimes taking place in long and short microchannels. All the simulations were carried out in three dimensions but some of obtained results concern two dimensional configurations. In this case, the third dimension is confined between two specularly reflecting walls so that the flow in the third direction to be homogeneous. Implicit boundary conditions were applied to maintain a given pressure at inlet and outlet (I/O) boundaries. For small Knudsen number gas flow, the DSMC results are compared to the continuum numerical solution of the Navier-Stokes-Fourier equations obtained by using SIMPLE-TS finite volume method.
