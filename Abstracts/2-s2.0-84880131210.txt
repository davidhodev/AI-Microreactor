Droplet-based microfluidic systems enable a variety of biomedical applications from point-of-care diagnostics with third world implications, to targeted therapeutics alongside medical ultrasound, to molecular screening and genetic testing. Though these systems maintain the key advantage of precise control of the size and composition of the droplet as compared to conventional methods of production, the low rates at which droplets are produced limits translation beyond the laboratory setting. As well, previous attempts to scale up shear-based microfluidic systems focused on increasing the volumetric throughput and formed large droplets, negating many practical applications of emulsions such as site-specific therapeutics. We present the operation of a parallel module with eight flow-focusing orifices in the dripping regime of droplet formation for the generation of uniform fine droplets at rates in the hundreds of kilohertz. Elevating the capillary number to access dripping, generation of monodisperse droplets of liquid perfluoropentane in the parallel module exceeded 3.69 × 105 droplets per second, or 1.33 × 109 droplets per hour, at a mean diameter of 9.8 μm. Our microfluidic method offers a novel means to amass uniform fine droplets in practical amounts, for instance, to satisfy clinical needs, with the potential for modification to form massive amounts of more complex droplets. © 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.
