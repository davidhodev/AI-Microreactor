Â© 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.Pressure-sensitive paint is an experimental technique that has been developed for decades and recently applied for microscale measurements to retrieve surface pressure data. Promising results have been reported at various flow regions including transition flow, supersonic flow, and unsteady flow regimes. The experimental results acquired by pressure-sensitive paint have been compared with computational simulation and theoretical analysis, and good agreements have been established. This technique provides not only qualitative information but also quantitative data for the flow field inside microfluidic systems. This paper summarizes the methodology and applications of pressure-sensitive paint in microscale measurements as well as their usage for oxygen detection in several areas. Critical comments and future aspects of the technique have also been provided.
