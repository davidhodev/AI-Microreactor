Â© 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry. The anisotropic wetting characteristics of scalloped nanogrooves (SNGs) were investigated for the first time. SNGs with various scallop edge angles were fabricated by Bosch deep reactive ion etching (DRIE). The wetting properties of the nanopatterned surfaces were studied in dynamic and static regimes. The anisotropic wettability of the SNGs was successfully employed to control fluid flows in microfluidic channels.
