The performances of a single microband electrode probing within a microfluidic channel, the passage of a concentration front of electroactive species,were investigated. Optimal conditions in terms of device geometries and hydrodynamic flow were delineated to allowamperometric detectionswith high temporal resolution. These conditions correspond to specific regimes reflecting the complex coupling between diffusional and convective transport. Experimental current responses were in excellent agreement with the theoretical predictions. A new concept of microchannel electrodes acting as concentration probes was thus successfully demonstrated. Â© 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
