The work in question addresses the issue of continuous flow particle manipulation in liquid media with particular emphasis on particles with micron and sub-micron dimensions. The subject is of significant relevance for a range of biotechnological applications and in particular for lab-on-chip ones. Particle manipulation utilizing Interface Acoustic Waves (IAW) is proposed for the first time. Manipulation of submicron sized particles is successfully demonstrated in a streaming free regime.
