The effect of confinement on the droplet formation in T junctions was studied for three configurations of fluid injection. The sizes of the main droplets and the satellite droplets were measured in the squeezing and dripping regimes. The evolution of droplet sizes with capillary number in the continuous phase is similar to that in flow-focusing junctions, i.e., the size of the main droplets decreases with an increase of this capillary number, while the size of the satellite droplets increases with an increase of this capillary number. While in the range of flow rates investigated the injection configuration does not exhibit a significant effect on the main droplet sizes, it does have an effect on the size of the satellite droplets. The latter ones are smaller when the neck rupture of the droplet occurs on an angle of the microsystem. Â© 2014 American Physical Society.
