Fluid mixing is an extremely important process widely used in various microfluidic devices (chemical microreactors, chemical and biological analyzers, drug delivery systems, etc.). To increase the mixing rate, it is necessary to use special devices: micromixers. This paper presents the results of a hydrodynamic simulation of Y-shaped micromixers. Flows are analyzed for both low and moderate Reynolds numbers. The passive and active mixers are considered. The dependence of the mixing efficiency on the Reynolds and Péclet numbers, as well as the possibility of using the hydrophobic and ultra-hydrophobic coatings is analyzed. Five different flow regimes were identified: (1) stationary vortex-free flow (Re < 5); (2) stationary symmetric vortex flow with two horseshoe vortices (5 < Re < 150); (3) stationary asymmetric vortex flow (150 < Re < 240); (4) non-stationary periodic flow (240 < Re < 400); and (5) stochastic flow (Re > 400). The maximum mixing efficiency was obtained for stationary asymmetric vortex flow.
