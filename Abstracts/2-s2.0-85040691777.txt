Accumulation of soluble sugars in watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) fruit, a major quality trait, had been selected during domestication. Still, the molecular mechanisms controlling this quantitative trait are unknown. We resequenced 96 recombinant inbred lines, derived from crossing sweet and unsweet accessions, to narrow down the size of a previously described sugar content quantitative trait locus, which contains a putative Tonoplast Sugar Transporter gene (ClTST2). Molecular and biochemical analyses indicated that ClTST2 encodes a vacuolar membrane protein, whose expression is associated with tonoplast uptake and accumulation of sugars in watermelon fruit flesh cells. We measured fruit sugar content and resequenced the genomic region surrounding ClTST2 in 400 watermelon accessions and associated the most sugar-related significant singlenucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to the ClTST2 promoter. Large-scale population analyses strongly suggest increased expression of ClTST2 as a major molecular event in watermelon domestication associated with a selection sweep around the ClTST2 promoter. Further molecular analyses explored the binding of a sugar-induced transcription factor (SUSIWM1) to a sugar-responsive cis‐element within the ClTST2 promoter, which contains the quantitative trait locus (QTL) causal SNP. The functional characterization of ClTST2 and its expression regulation by SUSIWM1 provide novel tools to increase sugar sink potency in watermelon and possibly in other vegetable and fruit crops.
