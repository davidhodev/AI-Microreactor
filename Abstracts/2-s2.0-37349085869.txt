The dynamics of liquid water transport through the gas diffusion layer (GDL) and into a gas flow channel are investigated with an ex situ experimental setup. Liquid water is injected through the bottom surface of the GDL, and the through-plane liquid pressure drop, droplet emergence and droplet detachment are studied. The dynamic behaviour of water transport in and on the surface of the GDL is observed through fluorescence microscopy, and the through-plane liquid pressure drop is measured with a pressure transducer. With an initially dry GDL, the initial breakthrough of liquid water in the GDL is preceded by a substantial growth of liquid water pressure. Post-breakthrough, droplets emerge with a high frequency, until a quasi-equilibrium liquid water pressure is achieved. The droplet emergence/detachment regime is followed by a transition into a slug formation regime. During the slug formation regime, droplets tend to pin near the breakthrough location, and the overall channel water content increases due to pinning and the formation of water slugs. Droplets emerge from the GDL at preferential breakthrough locations; however, these breakthrough locations change intermittently, suggesting a dynamic interconnection of water pathways within the GDL. The experiments are complemented by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations using the volume of fluid method to illustrate the dynamic eruption mechanism. Â© 2007 Elsevier B.V.
