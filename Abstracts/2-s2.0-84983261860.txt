Â© 15CBMS-0001. The mechanism of T-cell activation plays a central role in immunity. T-cells responses are initiated in the paracortical region of the lymph node, where antigen-bearing dendritic cells (DCs) activate antigen-specific T-cells. However, this activation and the effects of increased fluid pressure on T-cell:DC interaction have been barely addressed. In the present study, we demonstrate a microfluidic platform that has potential to measure T-cell:DC heterotypic detachment forces using laminar flow, in order to understand T-cell activation, combining physical and mechanical forces regimes similar to those found in vivo. In this particular study, the detachment forces between 1-10 dynes/cm2 were experimentally found.
