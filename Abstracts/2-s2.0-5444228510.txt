We have developed a teaching module to engage undergraduate engineering students in an introductory research project. Pairs of students proposed and carried out self-designed projects to study diffusion in microfluidic channels. These channels create laminar flow regimes where dissimilar fluids flow side-by-side and mix through diffusion. Custom-built hardware and software allowed students to make quantitative measurements of diffusion. Draft reports structured as scientific papers were reviewed by technical staff, writing staff, and peers. Students used these reviews to revise their reports and make additional measurements as needed. Grades were based on the quality of the final report, with emphasis on students' documentation of the research process. Student feedback verified that the lab project improved understanding of course material, demonstrated the importance of technical writing in the scientific process, and emphasized the value of teamwork. The lab has been adopted in multiple courses at both MIT and Yale to teach molecular transport, microfabrication, and other topics. All information needed to recreate the lab is freely available online.
