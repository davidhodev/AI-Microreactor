This article reports on a proof-of-concept system composed of a droplet based surface plasmon resonance (SPR) system coupled to a surface acoustic wave (SAW) microfluidic plateform. It is now well established that surface based binding analyses such as SPR are highly influenced by the transport of analyte to the sensing surface. Further, obtaining reliable equilibrium in flow cells to realize quantification studies is not straightforward. An original solution compared to generally used pressure driven flows is then proposed to favourably cope with these issues. Efficiency of SAW microstreaming coupled to SPR biosensing is considered, in order to improve the accuracy of kinetic parameter estimation in mass transport limited regime and to realize reliable quantification studies. First, the droplet based SPR technique and its advantages are presented. Then, the integration of the microstreaming on the system is discussed. Streptavidin binding is then monitored in static mode and under SAW streaming mode. Â© 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
