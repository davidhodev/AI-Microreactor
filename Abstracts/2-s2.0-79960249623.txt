The aim of this work is to investigate experimentally the bubble breakup in a microfluidic T-junction divergence using a high-speed digital camera and a micro-Particle Image Velocimetry (micro-PIV) system. The breakup and non-breakup of N2 bubbles in glycerol-water mixtures with several concentrations of sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) as surfactant were studied with capillary number ranging from 0.001 to 0.1. The cross section of PMMA square microchannel is 400γm wide and 400γm deep. Four various flow patterns were observed at the T-junction by changing gas and liquid flow rates. The dynamics of three various types of symmetric breakup of bubbles were investigated. The symmetric breakup of bubbles type I is mainly controlled by the augmented pressure in liquid phase. The symmetric breakup of bubbles type II is controlled by both the increased pressure and viscous forces. In the symmetric breakup of bubbles type III, a scaling law for the minimum bubble neck and the remaining time during bubble breaking process were found. The transitions between breakup and non-breakup of bubbles were investigated, and a power-law relationship between bubble extension and capillary number was proposed to predict the transitions between adjacent regimes. Our experimental results reveal that the bubble breakup in a microfluidic T-junction divergence is similar to the droplet behaviours in such a device (Jullien et al., 2009; Leshansky and Pismen, 2009; Link et al., 2004). © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
