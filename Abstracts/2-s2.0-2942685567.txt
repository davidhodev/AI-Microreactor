Various aspects of microfluidic flows with different immiscible constituents are addressed. The fundamental physical characteristics are proposed, as well as the flow regimes which are determined by the wetting and surface tension properties. These fundamental aspects are followed by engineering applications that emerge in microfluidics, namely the creation of microbubbles or drops. Further applications are also discussed, such as the transfer of heat in bubbly flows, or the transport of colloids and emulsions. © 2004 Académie des sciences. Published by Elsevier SAS.
