The large comb line spacing on the order of hundreds of gigahertz allows for rapid acquisition of absorption spectra in the condensed matter phase without aliasing via a dual-comb interferometer. We present a proof-of-principle demonstration of high-throughput label-free microresonator-based dual-comb spectroscopy in a microfluidic chip that dynamically probes the linear absorption of liquid acetone in the mid-infrared wavelength regime. We measure the flow dynamics of an acetone droplet with a spectral acquisition rate of 25 kHz (40 μs per spectrum) covering a spectral range from 2900 to 2990 nm. Combining microfluidics and silicon-photonic technology would potentially enable a compact time-resolved spectroscopy system for a wide range of applications such as chemical synthesis, biological cell-sorting, and lab-on-a-chip.
