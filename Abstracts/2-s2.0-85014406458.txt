Â© 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd. MgO nanoparticles (NPs) have been synthesized by a simple and eco-friendly route using watermelon juice as a novel fuel. The synthesized MgO NPs have been subjected to detailed characterization using various analytical techniques. The XRD pattern confirms the crystal structure of MgO which is composed of cubic phase of periclase. The FTIR spectrum gave another manifest from the presence of Mg-O bonding at 552 cm -1 . The surface structure, morphology and particle size have been studied using SEM and TEM which show the MgO NPs are in agglomerated form, almost spherical in shape and average size is about 30-50 nm. Finally, the multidimensional studies have been examined by subjecting MgO NPs as a catalyst from the photodegradation of methylene blue dye (one of the most commonly encountered environmental pollutants), antibacterial activities and electrochemical sensing from the detection of hydrazine at trace level concentration.
