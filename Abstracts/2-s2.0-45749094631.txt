In this paper a numerical simulation technique has been used to evaluate the possibilities of cyclone application in molten aluminium processing by determining the fluid flow for flow velocities of 0.01 m/s, 0.1 m/s and 1 m/s; particle behavior for discrete particle sizes in the range of 20-100 Î¼m; particle densities of 2660-3980 kg/m3; and the collection efficiency of the cyclone. The geometrical aspects have been discussed. The results show that the cyclone concept can be effectively used as an alternative method to remove the impurities from a stream of molten aluminium in a wide range of flow regimes. A pilot installation is being built for validation of the used model in terms of collection efficiency; and for casting trials [1].
