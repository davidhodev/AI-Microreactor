An experimental campaign was carried out studying laminar and turbulent heat transfer in uniformly heated smooth glass and rough stainless steel microtubes from 0.5 mm down to 0.12 mm. Heat transfer in turbulent regime proved to be coherent - within experimental accuracy - with the classic Gnielinski correlation for the Nusselt number. For the laminar case, an anomalous drop in Nusselt number for decreasing Reynolds number was observed in the smooth glass tubes. As the stainless steel tubes manifested relatively normal diabatic behaviour in this regime (apart from the evident influence of the thermal development region that increases heat transfer above the thermally fully developed value), the explanation of this unexpected diminution of the Nusselt number must be sought in the dispersion of heat, put in externally through the thin film deposited on the glass tube outer surface, to peripheral attachments to the test section. This distorts the measured energy balance of the experiment, especially as the convective force of the fluid diminishes, resulting in lower Nusselt numbers at lower Reynolds numbers.
