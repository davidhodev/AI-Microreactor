The proceedings contain 88 papers. The special focus in this conference is on Bioinformatics and Biomedical Engineering. The topics include: Discrimination between normal driving and braking intention from driverâ€™s brain signals; unsupervised parametrization of nano-objects in electron microscopy; models of multiple interactions from collinear patterns; identification of the treatment survivability gene biomarkers of breast cancer patients via a tree-based approach; workflows and service discovery: A mobile device approach; chloroplast genomes exhibit eight-cluster structuredness and mirror symmetry; are radiosensitive and regular response cells homogeneous in their correlations between copy number state and surviving fraction after irradiation?; Protein tertiary structure prediction via SVD and PSO sampling; fighting fire with fire: Computational prediction of microbial targets for bacteriocins; SARAEasy: A mobile app for cerebellar syndrome quantification and characterization; a graph-based approach for querying protein-ligand structural patterns; Predicting disease genes from clinical single sample-based PPI networks; red blood cell model validation in dynamic regime; exploiting ladder networks for gene expression classification; simulation of blood flow in microfluidic devices for analysing of video from real experiments; alignment-free Z-curve genomic cepstral coefficients and machine learning for classification of viruses; a combined approach of multiscale texture analysis and interest point/corner detectors for microcalcifications diagnosis; an empirical study of word sense disambiguation for biomedical information retrieval system; modelling the release of moxifloxacin from plasma grafted intraocular lenses with rotational symmetric numerical framework; predicting tumor locations in prostate cancer tissue using gene expression; case-based reasoning systems for medical applications with improved adaptation and recovery stages.
