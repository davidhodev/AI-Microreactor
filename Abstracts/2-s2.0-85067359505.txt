Â© 2019, The Author(s).Rapid and efficient isolation of bacteria from complex biological matrices is necessary for effective pathogen identification in emerging single-cell diagnostics. Here, we demonstrate the isolation of intact and viable bacteria from whole blood through the selective lysis of blood cells during flow through a porous silica monolith. Efficient mechanical hemolysis is achieved while providing passage of intact and viable bacteria through the monoliths, allowing size-based isolation of bacteria to be performed following selective lysis. A process for synthesizing large quantities of discrete capillary-bound monolith elements and millimeter-scale monolith bricks is described, together with the seamless integration of individual monoliths into microfluidic chips. The impact of monolith morphology, geometry, and flow conditions on cell lysis is explored, and flow regimes are identified wherein robust selective blood cell lysis and intact bacteria passage are achieved for multiple gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. The technique is shown to enable rapid sample preparation and bacteria analysis by single-cell Raman spectrometry. The selective lysis technique presents a unique sample preparation step supporting rapid and culture-free analysis of bacteria for the point of care.
