We report experimental results on chaotic mass transport induced by alternating topological changes of magnetic particle chains actuated by a rotating magnetic field. We show the induced fluid flows and the level of fluid mixing for (1) the regime of rigid chain rotation and (2) the regime in which the chains periodically fragment and reform. The effects of the different actuation regimes on a biological binding reaction in the solution are also reported. We conclude that the alternating topological change of microparticle chains is an effective mechanism to achieve chaotic mixing and thereby promote and homogenize reactions in lab-on-a-chip systems.
