Particle migration is a relevant transport mechanism whenever suspensions flow in channels with gap size comparable to particle dimensions (e.g. microfluidic devices). Several theoretical as well as experimental studies have been performed on this topic, showing that the occurring of this phenomenon and the migration direction are related to particle size, flow rate, and the nature of the suspending liquid. In this work we perform a systematic analysis on the migration of a single particle in a sheared viscoelastic fluid through 2D finite element simulations in a Couette planar geometry. To focus on the effects of viscoelasticity alone, inertia is neglected. The suspending medium is modeled as a Giesekus fluid. An ALE particle mover is combined with a DEVSS/SUPG formulation with a log-representation of the conformation tensor giving stable and convergent results up to high flow rates. To optimize the computational effort and reduce the remeshing and projection steps, needed as soon as the mesh becomes too distorted, a 'backprojection' of the flow fields is performed, through which the particle in fact moves along the cross-streamline direction only, and the mesh distortion is hence drastically reduced. Our results, in agreement with recent experimental data, show a migration towards the closest walls, regardless of the fluid and geometrical parameters. The phenomenon is enhanced by the fluid elasticity, the shear thinning and strong confinements. The migration velocity trends show the existence of a master curve governing the particle dynamics in the whole channel. Three different regimes experienced by the particle are recognized, related to the particle-wall distance. The existence of a unique migration behavior and its qualitative aspects do not change by varying the fluid parameters or the particle size. Â© 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
