A new electroanalytical method for the characterization of global antioxidant capacity is proposed based on chronoamperometric responses monitored at microchannel band electrodes. This approach does not require any titrating species, biological elements, or precalibration curves. A thin-layer regime is established at the working electrode according to the geometry of the device and hydrodynamic flow rate. Under these conditions, the currents are directly proportional to the total concentration of antioxidants and do not depend on their respective diffusion coefficients. Measurements were performed with synthetic solutions and mixtures of four antioxidants used as sample tests: trolox, ascorbic acid, gallic acid, and caffeic acid. Operating potentials were selected at the formal potentials of some reactive oxygen species to simulate their oxidative attacks. The very good agreement obtained between simulations and experimental data validated this new electroanalytical procedure. These results pave the way for the concept of innovative sensor-type microfluidic devices for alternative determination of antioxidant capacity. Â© 2013 American Chemical Society.
