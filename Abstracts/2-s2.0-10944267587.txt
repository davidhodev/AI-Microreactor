A simple colorimetric technique is implemented in a polymer microfluidic manifold. The simple chemistry aids an uncomplicated microchannel design, which is fabricated by CO2 laser ablation. Issues such as bonding of multiple layers, alignment of micro-fabricated structures and integration of optical components are addressed. A demonstration of a stopped flow regime in the microfluidic manifold is also presented. Â© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2003.
