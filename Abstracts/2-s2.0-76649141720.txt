Self-terminating electrochemical fabrication was used within a microfluidic channel to create a junction between two Au electrodes separated by a gap of 75 μm. During the electrochemical process of etching from the anode to deposition at the cathode, flow could be applied in the anode-to-cathode direction. Without applied flow, dendritic growth and dense branching morphologies were typically observed at the cathode. The addition of applied flow resulted in a densely packed gold structure that filled the channel. A computer simulation was developed to explore regimes where the diffusion, flow, and electric field between the electrodes individually dominated growth. The model provided good qualitative agreement relating flow to the experimental results. The model was also used to contrast the effects of open and closed boundaries and electric field strength, as factors related to tapering. © 2010 The American Physical Society.
