Experimental investigation, numerical simulation and analytical modelling of forced convection are presented. An electrocaloric mass-flow sensor is the object of investigations. The convective heat lost and the influence of the flow over the temperature field have been measured and calculated. The influence of flow regimes over forced convection in a microfluid system is shown. Applications and further work are discussed at the end of the paper.
