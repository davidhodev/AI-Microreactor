Â© 2018 University of Chemical Technology and Metallurgy. This paper presents the investigation of Horseradish peroxidase (HPR) immobilization on poly-(acrylonitrile- co-acrylamide) and polyamide membranes using three different regimes of a fluid movement: a turbulent, a laminar and an intermediate one. The turbulent movement of the liquid is realized through a magnetic stirrer application. The laminar flow is achieved in a microfluidic system, while the attached amount of enzymes is monitored by a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM). The third type of movement, a fluid movement in an inclined pipe with a varied angle of inclination, is realized in a laboratory made rig. We find that the type of flow influences the immobilized enzyme amount, the time of the immobilization and the structure of the immobilized film. The main conclusion is that the laminar flow favours the process of covalent immobilization most probably because of the orientation of the molecules and their movement parallel to the carrier surface.
