This paper analyses the transient behavior of a Newtonian flow, between parallel surfaces, driven by buoyancy forces, in miniaturized systems. The problem is numerically solved, assuming uniform wall temperature conditions (UWT), and accounting for the rarefaction effect. The numerical solution is validated resorting to analytical solutions available in literature. The first benchmark is carried out thanks to a recent analytical solution obtained for no slip conditions (Kn = 0), in the same geometry, and UWT conditions. A second benchmark is carried out thanks to an analytical solution obtained in slip flow steady state. The benchmarks confirm that the numerical solution provides results quite accurate and reliable.
