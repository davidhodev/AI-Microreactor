Â© American Society for Engineering Education, 2017. Micro-Electrical-Mechanical-Systems (MEMS) and Nanotechnology engineering education platforms based on thin film engineering have broad applications across all disciplines in science from semiconductor chip fabrication and accelerometers in unmanned aerial vehicles, to in-vivo medical instrumentation. Fabrication of real world thin film devices is an expensive, complex engineering effort that is not extensible to classroom laboratory environments. Having numerous cross disciplinary applications, fluid dynamics lends itself as a good model subject for laboratory demonstration of MEMS; flow visualization makes for an appealing demo, fluid flow scales to the nano regime, and fabrication of a UV epoxy microfluidic channel can be designed in a way that mimics standard MEMS fabrication techniques. UV epoxy has become a standard and relatively inexpensive material used in numerous optical applications and therefore is relatively inexpensive and readily available. Our fabrication technique follows the same general procedures used in MEMS: creation of a mask, photolithography, bonding, etching, and packaging. Fluidic channels are created between two glass slides in a thin layer of UV epoxy, the channels formed by flushing uncured epoxy with solvent. The microfluidic platform developed has been used in a chemical engineering fluid dynamics class for demonstrating various fluid dynamic phenomena, with a specific focus on frictional losses associated with various designs. In combining a fluid dynamic platform using MEMS fabrication techniques, a cross-disciplinary experimental engineering platform has been developed that can be further expanded into a teaching module including optics, surface chemistry, heat flow, as well as electrical phenomena.
