© 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim Performances of a newly developed microprocess in producing size-controlled nanoemulsions in the lower nanometer range are assessed. The microprocess comprises an elongational-flow micromixer with a bore size of either 150, 250, or 500 μm. By inducing a reciprocating flow through the restriction of the micromixer, methyl methacrylate (MMA)-based nanoemulsions with controlled sizes in the range 50–300 nm are successfully prepared at low pressures (ca. 2.5 bars) in laminar to intermediate hydrodynamic flow regimes. Effect of process parameters (flow rate through the restriction, number of cycles), micromixer parameters (angle, bore size), and finally composition parameters (weight content of MMA and surfactant, dispersed to continuous phase viscosity ratio) on nanodroplet size and size distribution is thoroughly studied. A unique empirical correlation is extracted from the experimental results and is found to fairly well model the variations of the nanodroplet size with aforementioned parameters. (Figure presented.).
