The Letter reports an experimental study of microfluidic droplets produced in T junctions and subjected to a local periodic forcing. Synchronized and quasiperiodic regimes-organized into Arnold tongues and devil staircases-are reported for the first time for a system dedicated to drop emission. The nature of the dynamical regime controls the droplet characteristics. These phenomena are mostly controlled by the characteristics of the forcing and the flow conditions.
