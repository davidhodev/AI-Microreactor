Droplet formation in a wide-type microfluidic T-junction was studied using the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method. Two distinct regimes of droplet formation were confirmed: dripping and jetting; and, at both regimes, droplet size decreases with an increase in capillary number. CFD simulation demonstrated that droplet formation in the T-junction can be divided into three steps: droplet emergence and growing up; separation with the disperse phase; and detachment from the channel wall. The wettability of the channel wall significantly affects the process of droplet detachment from the channel wall; also, the simulation clearly showed that droplets can be formed only when the continuous phase fluid preferentially wets the channel wall, that is, its contact angle on the wall is smaller than 90°. Finally, the CFD study verified that the disperse phase flow rate can significantly affect the droplet size as well as the mechanism of droplet formation. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.
