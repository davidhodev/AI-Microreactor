Microreactors incorporating thin film resistive heating elements for continuous flow organic synthesis are presented. Internal thermal conditions were monitored in real time using reflectance spectra of temperature sensitive thermochromic liquid crystals (TLC) in a collateral microfluidic network. To demonstrate the precise temperature control provided by this method, the thermal optimisation of the Reimer-Tiemann formylation of β-naphthol was performed under hydrodynamic pumping regimes. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2005.
