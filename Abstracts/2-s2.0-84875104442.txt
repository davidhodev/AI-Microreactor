The 2013 Special Issue of Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics sheds light on the different aspects in microfluidics research starting from fundamental research reaching all the way to industrial applications. Nunes and co-researchers review the different regimes when replacing one of the fluids by an oil phase and varying flow rates and device geometries with a particular emphasis on using multiphase microfluidics for synthesis of particles or fibres. Tran and co-workers move a considerable step towards applicability of water-in-oil emulsions for biological research and review ultrahigh-throughput methods used for bio-assays. The article by Lagus et al focuses this topic specifically on single-cell experiments. Wang and researchers fabricate microcrawlers that can be thermally set in motion. Finally, Holtze gives a perspective on the possibility to upscale and apply such methods in industry.
