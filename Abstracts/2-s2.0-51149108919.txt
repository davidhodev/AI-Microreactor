The flow focusing geometry is one of several used in microfluidic devices to form monodisperse emulsion droplets. The addition of surfactant leads to the observation of a thread formation regime which has features similar to tip-streaming seen in deformed droplets. This thread formation regime has the potential to decouple the droplet size from the device lengthscales and provides a mechanism to form sub-micron droplets. Here, we present results demonstrating the impact of viscosity ratio on the phenomenon. Â© 2008 American Institute of Physics.
