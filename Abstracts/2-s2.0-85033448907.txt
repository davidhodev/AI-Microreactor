Passive mixing based on microfluidics has won its popularity for its unique advantage, including easier operation, more efficient mixing performance and higher access to high integrity. The time-scale and performance of mixing process are usually characterized by mixing quality, which has been remarkably improved due to the introduction of chaos theory into passive micro mixers. In this paper, we focus on the research of mixing phenomenon at extremely low Reynold number (Re) regime in a chaotic herringbone mixer. Three-dimensional (3D) modeling has been carried out using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method, to simulate the chaos-enhanced advection diffusion process. Static mixing processes using pressure driven and electric field driven modes are investigated. Based on the simulation results, the effects of flow field and herringbone pattern are theoretically studied and compared. Both in pressure driven flow and electro-osmotic flow (EOF), the mixing performance is improved with a lower flow rate. Moreover, it is noted that with a same total flow rate, mixing performance is better in EOF than pressure driven flow, which is mainly due to the difference in flow field distribution of pressure driven flow and EOF.
