The aim of this experiment was to study the relationship between yield ad antioxidant enzyme activity in leaves of different ecological types of watermelon during flowering period. Eleven watermelon varieties with different eco-Types were grew in gravel - mulched field (water shortage) and normal water supply condition, the malondialdehyde (MDA), proline content and antioxidant enzymes activity such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and peroxidase (POD) in leaves were measured. The results showed that there existed marked drought stress in gravel-mulched field, yields of all types of watermelon were decreased, being 18.6% 35.3% and 59.7% 67.8% in large fruit size and small fruit size, respectively, suggesting that large fruit size possessed stronger drought resistance than that of small one. In addition, there were significant differences among varieties. Under drought stress, MDA, proline content, as well a SOD, POD, CAT activity in leaves were increased, indicating that watermelon was sensitive to drought. Moreover, the response of watermelon to drought were variety dependent. The content of proline, activity of SOD, POD, CAT in large fruit size varieties in creased by 83.2%. 121.4%., 55.2%. 75.3%, 118.1% -204.4%., 52.0%. 86.6%., respectively, the rage was greater than that of small fruit size varieties, meanwhile, the content of MDA increased by 13.4% - 39. 8%, the rage was smaller than that of small fruit size. Taking fruit yield ad physiological response into consideration, we argued that all ecotypes of watermelons gained a certain yield level under gavel-mulched conditions, ad large fruit watermelon had a stronger drought resistance tha small fruit did. Zhongqing 9, NWU - 13, Longkag 9, Longkag 11, JY12 and Jinkang 5 had stronger drought resistance, which may be suitable for gavel-mulch! field.
