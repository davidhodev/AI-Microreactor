Prior to detection of specific low-concentrated biomarkers a pretreatment step is necessary in most cases. Here we present a novel approach for the periodic convection of superparamagnetic beads for intensified up-concentration and biomarker labeling. In contrast to previous approaches, where dynamic switching fields were applied, our system can be activated within a static field, but still allows a controlled movement in two directions. By introducing softmagnetic structures, the magnetic field as well as the field gradient can be periodically modulated along the microfluidic channel. Suitable shapes of pole pieces were analyzed using Finite Element Method simulation before the microsystem was micro-fabricated and tested. Experiments show how the flow rate within the channel and the magnetic field cooperate to establish an operational regime in which periodic convection can be established and controlled.
