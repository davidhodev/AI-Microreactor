Microparticle adsorption on microchannel walls occurs frequently due to nonspecific interactions, decreasing operational performance in pressure-driven microfluidic systems. However, it is essential for delicate manipulation of microparticles or cells to maintain smooth fluid traffic. Here, we report a novel microparticle injection technique, which prevents particle loss, assisted by sample injection along the direction of fluid flow. Sample fluids, including microparticles, mammalian (U937), and green algae (Chlorella vulgaris) cells, were injected directly via a through hole drilled in the lateral direction, resulting in a significant reduction in microparticle attachment. For digital microfluidic application, the proposed regime achieved a twofold enhancement of single-cell encapsulation compared to the conventional encapsulation rate, based on a Poisson distribution, by reducing the number of empty droplets. This novel interconnection method can be straightforwardly integrated as a microparticle or cell injection component in integrated microfluidic systems. Â© 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
