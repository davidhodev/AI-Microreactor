Â© 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.A micromixer with consistent mixing performance for a wide range of flow rates is presented. The mixer makes use of internally moving elements, i.e. steel balls that are located in dedicated mixing chambers. Movement is induced by a rotating magnetic field. To get better insight in differences between active and passive mixing, we studied a mixer that can operate in both regimes. A mixing performance study for a range of flow rates along with pressure drop data is presented. The response of the moving elements in regard to the magnetic field is shown experimentally and shows the limitations of earlier modeling studies. Lastly, the estimated power input on the fluids was calculated and allows for a comparison with more well-known convective-type mixers.
