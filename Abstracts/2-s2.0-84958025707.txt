© 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.Herein we present a microfluidic-multiplexed platform that integrates electrochemical sensors based on carbon nanotubes associated with ferrocene as redox marker (carbon nanotube (CNT)/ferrocene) for direct detection of pathogenic viral DNA from Hepatitis C and genomic DNA from Mycobacterium tuberculosis in clinical isolates. By operating the fluidic device under high flow (150 μl/min), the formation of a very thin depletion layer at the sensor surface (δS = 230 nm) enhances the capture rate up to one DNA strand per second. By comparison, this capture rate is only 0.02 molecule/s in a static regime without flow. This fluidic protocol allows thus enhancing the limit of detection of the electrochemical biosensor from picomolar in bulk solution to femtomolar with a large dynamic range from 0.1 fM to 1 pM. Kinetics analysis also demonstrates an enhancement of the rate constant of electron transfer (kS) of the electrochemical process from 1 s-1 up to 6 s-1 thanks to the geometry of the miniaturized fluidic electrochemical cell. This microfluidic device working under high flow allows selective direct detection of a Mycobacterium tuberculosis (H37Rv) rpoB allele from clinical isolate extracted DNA. We envision that a microfluidic approach under high flow associated with a multiwall CNT/ferrocene sensor could find useful applications as the point-of-care for multi-target diagnostics of biomarkers in real samples.
