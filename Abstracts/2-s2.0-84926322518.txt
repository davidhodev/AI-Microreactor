Copyright © 2014 by ASME. Microparticle collection in microfluidic systems via mechanical vibrations has been demonstrated in both low frequency systems (in the range of 100Hz) and in the high frequency regime (in the range of 1MHz). However, in most systems, collection of particles with lower inertia is hindered by second order time averaged streaming flows. In our approach, we experimentally demonstrate collection of small particles (about 3 μm in diameter) by trapping them in streaming flows in a liquid filled open rectangular chamber undergoing vertical vibrations at low frequencies. The proposed method is then utilized to separate two different types of particles in distinct patterns through mode switching.
