This work presents a microfluidic chip that enables the comparative culturing of single cells, immobilized along both walls of a channel, and exposed to different media under a laminar-flow regime. The key feature is that single cells can be reliably trapped using hydrodynamic forces and selectively released on-demand by using negative dielectrophoretic forces. This combined system allows for controlled population of trapping sites before a certain experiment and for release of individual cells showing interesting behavior during or after specific compound exposure.
