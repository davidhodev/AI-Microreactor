In this work we studied the flow of immiscible fluids in rectangular microfluidic channels with a T junction. Depending on the flow rate of the aqueous and oil phase, various flow such as parallel flows or monodisperse droplets are obtained in the outlet channel. We focused on the transition from droplet regime to parallel flows. Due to the confinement and the flow, this transition cannot be described by capillary arguments. The mechanism of droplet formation mechanism in the channel is elucidating using confocal microscopy and high speed imaging. The formation can be depicted in a blocking-pinching mechanism. We are working on a convective instability analysis to predict the transition between parallel flow and droplet formation.
