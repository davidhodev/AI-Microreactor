The solutions of the flow over a plate and a cylinder with suction and anisotropic partial slip are discussed. Viscous flow with partial slip occurs in a variety of situations such as the slip regime of rarefied gases and also models the boundary of rough or grooved surfaces. The anisotropy may be caused by parallel slits on the surface through which suction occurs if there are no slips, the solution reduces to the exact asymptotic suction flow. The no-slip boundary condition on a rough or striated surface is very difficult to enforce. The theoretical determination of the slip coefficient can be obtained from microfluid dynamics study of the roughness because the local Reynolds number is small, the slip coefficients are determined under the Stokes assumption for surfaces composed of parallel, semi-infinite fins parallel thin slats in the same plane and parallel grooves of infinite of finite depths.
