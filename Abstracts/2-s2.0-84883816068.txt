We report on a microfluidic device and droplet formation regime capable of generating clinical-scale quantities of liquid perfluoropentane droplets suitable in size and functionality for gas embolotherapy. We examine three modes of droplet formation in our flow-focusing device - geometry-controlled, dripping, and jetting - then use the dripping regime to generate highly monodisperse droplets in the range of 3-6 μm in diameter at rates exceeding 105 droplets per second. The phasechange droplets in this study are stable for weeks at room temperature yet undergo rapid liquid-to-gas phase transition, and volume expansion, above a uniform activation threshold.
