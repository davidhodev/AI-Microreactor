The electrokinetic behavior of nanofluidic devices is dominated by the electrical double layers at the device walls. Therefore, accurate, predictive models of double layers are essential for device design and optimization. In this paper, we demonstrate that density functional theory (DFT) of electrolytes is an accurate and computationally efficient method for computing finite ion size effects and the resulting ion-ion correlations that are neglected in classical double layer theories such as Poisson-Boltzmann. Because DFT is derived from liquid-theory thermodynamic principles, it is ideal for nanofluidic systems with small spatial dimensions, high surface charge densities, high ion concentrations, and/or large ions. Ion-ion correlations are expected to be important in these regimes, leading to nonlinear phenomena such as charge inversion, wherein more counterions adsorb at the wall than is necessary to neutralize its surface charge, leading to a second layer of co-ions. We show that DFT, unlike other theories that do not include ion-ion correlations, can predict charge inversion and other nonlinear phenomena that lead to qualitatively different current densities and ion velocities for both pressure-driven and electro-osmotic flows. We therefore propose that DFT can be a valuable modeling and design tool for nanofluidic devices as they become smaller and more highly charged. Â© 2011 Elsevier Inc.
