Studying gaseous flows in microsystems requires that rarefaction effects be taken into account. The significant length scales for gaseous microflows and the encountered flow regimes are presented. The analytical methods for the modeling of the slip flow regime, frequent in microfluidic applications, are detailed. Numerical methods for the simulation of micro gaseous flows are also examined, with emphasis on the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo method. Finally, some specific applications of thermal micropumping based on rarefaction effects are presented. © 2004 Académie des sciences. Publié par Elsevier SAS. Tous droits réservés.
