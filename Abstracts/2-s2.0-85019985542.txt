Â© 2017 American Chemical Society.We introduce an effective method to actively induce droplet generation using negative pressure. Droplets can be generated on demand using a series of periodic negative pressure pulses. Fluidic network models were developed using the analogy to electric networks to relate the pressure conditions for different flow regimes. Experimental results show that the droplet volume is correlated to the pressure ratio with a power law of 1.3. Using a pulsed negative pressure at the outlet, we are able to produce droplets in demand and with a volume proportional to the pulse width.
