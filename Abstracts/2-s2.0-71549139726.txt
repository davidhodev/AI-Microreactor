A sensor system combining a novel pressure stable thermoelectric flow and impedimetric sensor for monitoring chemical conversion in micro fluidic channels was developed. Devices were optimized for hydraulic diameters ~1 mm and overpressure regime. Impedimetric sensors consist of a pair of interdigital electrodes deposited on a silicon substrate. Thermoelectric flow sensors consist of a perforated membrane with a heater in between two thermocouples. Based on our results both sensors can detect in parallel relative changes in thermal and electrical properties of less than 1 %. Thus the system enables the inline monitoring of chemical conversion by means of 4 parameters. Â© 2009.
