Â© Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.The use of lab-on-chip tools has been adopted in a wide variety of scientific fields. Hundreds of applications that speed up, miniaturize, or enable otherwise unfeasible assays have emerged in the last couple of decades [1, 2]. The microfluidic toolbox offers several advantages which make it a very attractive resource for biological studies: reduced sample volume, control of spatiotemporal chemical compositions, streamlined assays, precise and predictable fluid flow regimes, portability, and integration with sensors, actuators, controllers, and automation systems [1-3]. The main drive of the field has thus far focused on the development of microfluidic tools that replace conventional methods with proof-ofprinciple applications. However, widespread adoption of these technologies for fundamental research is still in progress. Microfluidics has nonetheless had a significant impact in fundamental biological studies with model organisms [4, 5]. In this article, we provide an overview of the current state of the field, the impacts of microfluidics in model organism research, and the outlook, challenges, and opportunities for the future.
