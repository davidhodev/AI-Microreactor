The fabrication, characterization and packaging of novel microfluidic-optical integrated biosensors for label-free biochemical detection is presented in this paper. The integrated device consists of a three-dimensional embedded microchannel network fabricated using enhanced CMOS compatible SU-8 multilevel polymer technology on top of a wafer containing Mach-Zehnder Interferometer (MZI) nanophotonic biosensor devices. PMMA housing provides connection to the macro-world and ensures robust leakage-free flow operation of the devices. This macro-microfluidic module can operate at pressure drops up to 1000 kPa. Fluid flow experiments have been performed in order to demonstrate the robustness of our microfluidic devices. The devices have been designed to operate under continuous flow. Steady-state flow rates ranging from 1 to 100 νl min-1 at pressure drops ranging from 10 to 500 kPa were measured in the laminar flow regime. Experimental results are in good agreement with laminar flow theory. The first interferometric sensing measurements are presented in order to demonstrate the functionality of these novel integrated devices for lab-on-a-chip and label-free biosensing applications. A bulk refractive index detection limit of 3.8 × 10 -6 was obtained, close to the minimum detected up to now by label-free biosensor devices without microfluidic integration. As far as we know, this is the first time that a label-free biosensor device is integrated within a microfluidic network using a wafer-level CMOS compatible process technology. © 2006 IOP Publishing Ltd.
