This is achieved by implementing a photosensitive surfactant in the water phases of a novel dual flow-focusing microfluidic configuration. UV illumination at 365 nm enables dynamic switch of the flow behavior between a stable dual jet regime (−UV) and a stable dual drop regime (+UV), thus allowing us to generate on-demand two distinct populations of water drops. These drops are fused and mixed downstream inside expansion chambers, offering both a dynamic control by light stimulation and a controllable degree of fusion and mixing by the positions of chambers. The mixing inside the fused drops is found to be much faster than diffusion due to the chaotic advection inside the moving drops.
