The flow regimen was optimized in order to create partitioning of the glass flow structures with central polymeric barriers. Attempts at forming such solid macromolecular barriers using the interface of two mobile miscible fluids were not successful. in situ crosslinking of albumin with glutaraldehyde only resulted in swollen crosslinked gels, while precipitation of cellulose acetate from acetone into water produced polymer aggregates that occupied the entire volume of the microfluidic devices. However, using immiscible dual laminar flows, solid membranes were obtained using ultrafast interfacially contained reactions. The resulting membranes were positioned specifically at the liquid interface and did not extend further. Using this method, nylon 6,6 interfacial polymerisation was achieved using adipoyl chloride in xylene and hexamethylenediamine in water. Thicknesses as low as 100 μm were observed. Interfacially crosslinked albumin membranes were obtained using terephthaloyl chloride as crosslinker. For these membranes, thicknesses as low as 16 μm were observed.
