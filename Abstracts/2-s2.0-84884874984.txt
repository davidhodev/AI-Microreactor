This paper presents an in-plane pneumatically actuated membrane-type microvalve, entirely made of Cyclic Olefin Polymer (COP). The body of the valve is fabricated following a robust hot-embossing method with SU-8 master moulds, producing devices with repetitive dimensions at wafer-level. Sealing is performed by applying a suitable solvent on the COP membrane, rendering monolithic devices, free from assembly errors. Various design parameters have been studied to obtain different working regimes, with maximum flow rates of 8.5 ml/min being successfully regulated and fully stopped. Owing to its fabrication method and characteristics, these devices represent a reliable and low-cost solution for the integration of microfluidic control in mass-produced lab-on-a-chip devices.
