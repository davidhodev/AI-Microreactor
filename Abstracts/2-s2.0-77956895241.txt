Harnessing hydrazoic acid in a microreactor! Tetrazoles have been synthesized in a very efficient manner by using a high-temperature/high-pressure process intensification regime. Despite the toxic and explosive nature of hydrazoic acid, the synthesis was conducted safely in continuous flow format with residence times as short as 2.5 minutes at 260□°C (see picture). © 2010 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
