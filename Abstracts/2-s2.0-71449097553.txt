Flow focusing devices (FFDs), with dimensions smaller than 100μm have recently been used for cell encapsulation. However, encapsulation of larger clusters of cells, like islets of Langerhans, is of considerable interest. Producing larger capsules requires larger FFDs. We focus here on the geometrical scaling-up between a small FFD (50μm) and a larger one (100μm, 200μm, 1mm). We determine the driving pressure conditions to obtain the droplet regime at any size of the FFD. A similar behavior of the device is experimentally obtained by a scaling of the dimensions by a ratio λ and a scaling of the driving pressures by the ratio 1/λ. ©2009 IEEE.
