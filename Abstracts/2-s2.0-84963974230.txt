Â© 2015 IEEE.Ammonia detoxification is one of the main functions of the liver results in production of urea. In this study ammonia elimination and urea production was simulated in a microchannel mimicking the hepatic porto central axis. Navier- Stockes equations along with convection equations were solved for the related species in the entire domain. Since the Reynolds number was small (~1) the fluid flow regime was laminar. Urea cycle was modeled regarding its four main enzymes. Twelve rate equations were also solved in order to obtain the concentration of each metabolites participating in urea cycle. Concentration of the urea reached its maximum ca. 1.2e-5 M at the end of the channel which is in good agreement with experimental results.
