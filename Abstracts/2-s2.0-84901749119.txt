We have designed and built a polymer-based microfluidic system for the realtime monitoring of enzyme activity by combining liquid-liquid two-phase flow with fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy (FCCS). Aqueous sample droplets were generated in a perfluorocarbon (FC 3283) carrier fluid with a nonionic fluoroussoluble surfactant (Perfluorooctanol, 10% v/v) in a polymer microchip operating in the capillary two-phase flow regime. The optical system was demonstrated to monitor controlled generation of highly regular droplets loaded with fluorescent beads at delivery rates ranging from 40 - 60 droplets s-1. Stable two-phase flow was promoted by rendering the walls of the microfluidic channel hydrophobic. Â© 2009 CBMS.
