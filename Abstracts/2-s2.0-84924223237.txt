This report presents a method of creating highly monodisperse single emulsions of high viscosity (≈100 cP for both dispersed and continuous phases) using glass-based microfluidics. This method utilises a three-phase flow technique, where internal water droplets are introduced into a would-be-jetting oil stream forcing the system into a quasi-dripping regime to produce highly monodisperse core–shell drops that later rupture to form single drops. Emulsions with droplet diameters between 75 and 120 μm with a C<inf>v</inf> < 2 % were created at flow rates of up to 500 μl/h using this three-phase technique where similar emulsions using the standard two-phase technique could not be obtained. The rate of addition of internal droplets to induce a quasi-dripping mode was found to be similar to the dominant perturbation frequencies required to rupture a jet according to Plateau–Rayleigh instability theory.
