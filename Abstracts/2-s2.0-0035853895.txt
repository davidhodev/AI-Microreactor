A microchemical device has been built in silicon and glass by using microfabrication methods including deep-reactive-ion etch technology, photolithography, and multiple wafer bonding. The microchemical system consists of a microfluidic distribution manifold, a microchannel array, and a 25-μm microfilter for immobilizing solid particulate material within the reactor chip and carrying out different heterogeneous chemistries. Multiple reagent streams (specifically, gas and liquid streams) are mixed on-chip, and the fluid streams are brought into contact by a series of interleaved, high-aspect-ratio inlet channels. These inlet channels deliver the reactants continuously and cocurrently to 10 reactor chambers containing standard catalytic particles. The performance of the microfabricated "packed-bed" reactor is compared to that of traditional multiphase packed-bed reactors in terms of fluid flow regimes, pressure drop, and mass transfer. The hydrogenation of cyclohexene is used as a model reaction to measure the mass transfer resistances. Overall mass transfer coefficients (KLα) are measured to range from 5 to 15 s-1-nearly 2 orders of magnitude larger than values reported in the literature for standard laboratory-scale reactors.
