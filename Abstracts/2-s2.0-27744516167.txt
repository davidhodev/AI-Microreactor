Electroosmotic flow (EOF) in microchannels is restricted to low Reynolds number regimes. Since the inertial forces are extremely weak in such regimes, turbulent conditions do not readily develop. Therefore, species mixing occurs primarily via diffusion, with the result that extended mixing channels are generally required. The present study considers a T-shaped microchannel configuration with a mixing channel of width W = 280 μm. Computational fluid dynamics simulations and experiments were performed to investigate the influence on the mixing efficiency of various geometrical parameters, including the side-channel width, the side-channel separation, and the number of side-channel pairs. The influence of different applied voltages is also considered. The numerical results reveal that the mixing efficiency can be enhanced to yield a fourfold improvement by incorporating two pairs of side channels into the mixing channel. It was also found that the mixing performance depends significantly upon the magnitudes of the applied voltages. © 2005 The Japan Society of Applied Physics.
