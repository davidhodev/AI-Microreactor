© 2015 Elsevier Ltd. Core-shell drops having millimetric dimensions have attracted a wide range of applications. Such drops cannot be achieved in typical microfluidic devices due to buoyancy-driven phase separation difficulties at low flow rates. A buoyancy assisted approach based on two-phase flow (core and shell phase) with the outer phase as quiescent and non-confined, is presented for producing large core-shell drops. Buoyancy was found to be the dominant force for drop formation in the surfactant-free system, but considerably less effective in the presence of surfactants. The drop formation was mostly limited to the dripping regime when the surfactant concentrations were low. A simple force-balance model is developed for the prediction of the core-shell and the core drop sizes, which are validated against the data obtained in a surfactant-free system. The suggested method gives highly monodisperse (coefficient of variation smaller than 3%) core-shell drops (radius R~800-3000. μm) with a wide range of absolute (. t~30-1000. μm) and relative (. t/R ~0.03-0.80) shell thickness.
