We present a novel microfluidic device that allows for the rapid production of monodisperse bulk emulsions in large volumes, directly inside a beaker filled with the carrier fluid. To do so, we massively parallelize the droplet production nozzles described in Dangla et. al. [1]. Contrary to classical flow focusing [2,3] or T-junction [4] techniques, this approach doesn't require a flow of the carrier phase and the device is operated by injecting the dispersed phase only. We demonstrate the production of droplets 80 μm in diameter at flow rates in the mL/min regime and at frequencies above 100 kHz.
