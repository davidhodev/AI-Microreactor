© 2018 IEEE.Active transport such as fluid flow is sought in molecular communication to extend coverage, improve reliability, and mitigate interference. Flow models are often over-simplified, assuming one-dimensional diffusion with constant drift. However, diffusion and flow are usually encountered in three-dimensional bounded environments where the flow is highly non-uniform such as in blood vessels or microfluidic channels. For a qualitative understanding of the relevant physical effects inherent to these channels, based on the Péclet number and the transmitter-receiver distance, we study when simplified models of uniform flow and advection-only transport are applicable. For these two regimes, analytical expressions for the channel impulse response are derived and validated by particle-based simulation. Furthermore, as advection-only transport is typically overlooked and hence not analyzed in the molecular communication literature, we evaluate the symbol error rate for exemplary on-off keying as performance metric.
