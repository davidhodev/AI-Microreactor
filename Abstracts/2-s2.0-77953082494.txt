The flow of polymer solutions in microfluidic devices is inherently three-dimensional, especially in the non-linear flow regime, and often results in flow phenomena that might not even be encountered in macro-devices. Using a multi-mode Phan-Thien-Tanner model, three-dimensional (3-D) simulations of a semi-dilute polyethylene oxide (PEO) solution through 8:1 planar contraction micro-channels with various depths have been carried out to systematically study the effect of the aspect ratio on the flow fields. Vortex dynamics in the upstream flow section and excess pressure drop are quantified in detail. A transition from a salient-corner vortex mechanism to a lip vortex mechanism is observed as the aspect ratio is varied from 1 to 1/4, which corresponds to the elasticity numbers El = 36.3 to 48.3. The numerical results show that varying the aspect ratio of microfluidic channels has similar effects to varying other parameters, such as fluid properties, which influence the elasticity number. Thus, our results support the view that vortex growth mechanism is determined by the elasticity number, which is fixed for a given fluid and geometry. The principle is of significance to the design of new microfluidic chips for a wide range of applications. Â© 2010 Springer-Verlag.
