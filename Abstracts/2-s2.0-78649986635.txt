Jammed systems all have a yield stress. Among these materials some have been shown to shear-band but it is as yet unclear why some materials develop shear-band and some others do not. In order to rationalize existing data concerning the flow characteristics of jammed systems and in particular understand the physical origin of such a difference, we propose a simple approach for describing the steady flow behaviour of yield stress fluids, which retains only basic physical ingredients. Within this framework we show that in the liquid regime the behaviour of jammed systems turns from that of a simple yield stress fluid (exhibiting homogeneous flows) to a shear-banding material when the ratio of a characteristic relaxation time of the system to a restructuring time becomes smaller than 1, thus suggesting a possible physical origin of these trends.
