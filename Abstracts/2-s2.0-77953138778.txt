The terminology Novel Process Window unites different methods to improve existing processes by applying unconventional and harsh process conditions like: process routes at much elevated pressure, much elevated temperature, or processing in a thermal runaway regime to achieve a significant impact on process performance. This paper is a review of parts of IMM's works in particular the applicability of above mentioned Novel Process Windows on selected chemical reactions. First, general characteristics of microreactors are discussed like excellent mass and heat transfer and improved mixing quality. Different types of reactions are presented in which the use of microstructured devices led to an increased process performance by applying Novel Process Windows. These examples were chosen to demonstrate how chemical reactions can benefit from the use of milli- and microstructured devices and how existing protocols can be changed toward process conditions hitherto not applicable in standard laboratory equipment. The used milli- and microstructured reactors can also offer advantages in other areas, for example, high-throughput screening of catalysts and better control of size distribution in a particle synthesis process by improved mixing, etc. The chemical industry is under continuous improvement. So, a lot of research is being done to synthesize high value chemicals, to optimize existing processes in view of process safety and energy consumption and to search for new routes to produce such chemicals. Leitmotifs of such undertakings are often sustainable development1 and Green Chemistry2. Â© 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
