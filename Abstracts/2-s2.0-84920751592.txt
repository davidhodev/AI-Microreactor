The physics that govern the operation of pressure force driven microfluidics are just a subset of principles governing macro scale fluidics, and low Reynolds number fluid mechanics is essential for the design and operation of pressure force driven microfluidic devices. This is because microfluidics almost exclusively only deals with slow velocity and small sizes. This chapter first provides a brief introduction to the necessary microfluidics basics required for understanding pressure force driven microfluidics, primarily focusing on laminar, viscous flow and the importance of force scaling relative to device size. Device examples start with pressure-driven flows in straight microchannels, the simplest but most important geometry. Various other devices then follow, including passive and active valves, mixers, on-chip pressure sources, flow sensors and device packaging. Finally, the chapter ends with some current and future applications for pressureforce- driven microfluidics and the remaining challenges facing microfluidics designers.
