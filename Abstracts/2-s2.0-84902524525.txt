Mixing of fluids at the microscale poses a variety of challenges, many of which arise from the fact that diffusion is the only available mechanism to achieve mixing in the laminar flow regime. In this work, we propose a novel hybrid micromixer design incorporating (i) an asymmetric serpentine geometry in which the channel width abruptly changes across successive bends (effective at Re > 1), and (ii) slanted barriers on the bottom channel surface (effective at Re < 1). The resulting hybrid design is capable of efficient mixing over a greatly expanded Re range than currently achievable. Copyright Â© 2005 by the Transducer Research Foundation, Inc.
