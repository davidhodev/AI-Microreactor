Â© 2015 The Royal Society of Chemistry. We developed a novel gradient generator to achieve long range and linear chemical gradients with a dynamic control function. The length of the gradient can be on the centimetre scale. The gradient profile can be tuned by changing the flow rates. The device can work in both high flow rate regimes with large shear stress and low flow rate regimes with minimum shear stress. The drug screening function was demonstrated by the viability test of PC-9 cancer cells.
