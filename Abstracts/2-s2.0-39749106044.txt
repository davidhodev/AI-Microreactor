This study reports on the dynamics of droplets in the capillary regime induced by electrowetting-on-dielectric actuation. The configuration investigated allows for comparing the experimental results with respect to the predictions of Brochard's theoretical model (Brochard in Langmuir 5:432-438, 1989). Firstly, side-view observations using stroboscopic recording techniques were used to measure and analyse droplet deformations as well as the front and rear apparent contact angles during motion. Secondly, the influence of viscosity on the droplet velocity as a function of the applied voltage was studied. This has revealed that low Reynolds number droplet motion can be described by the simple laminar viscous model of Brochard. Finally, the influence of the dielectric thickness on the droplet dynamics was studied. It is shown that droplet velocity is limited by a saturation effect of the driving electrostatic force and that this phenomenon is very similar to that occurring in static experiments.
