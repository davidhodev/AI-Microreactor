Â©(2018) by AIChE All rights reserved..Herein we describe a versatile strategy for fabricating of S/W/O compound droplets by means of a cross-flowing shearing technique in a microfluidic T-junction device. In the experiment, single encapsulation which contains only one solid core can be controllably obtained by adjusting the flow rate ratio of oil (O) to water (W) phases. Three kinds of flow patterns in single encapsulation, namely squeezing regime, dripping-like regime and jetting-like regime, can be distinguished by the flow rates in the side and main channels. At low flow rates of both phases, the squeezing regime occurs, in which the pressure drop is the dominant force to break off the neck. With increasing the flow rate in the main channel, a dripping-like regime can be identified. A high flow rates in the side and main channels contribute to the formation of the jetting-like regime, in which the inertia force cannot be ignored. The formed S/W/O compound droplets in dripping-like regime have a high monodispersity. Further, by solidification of the S/W/O compound droplets, the polystyrene (PS) - polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) double-layer shells can be successfully prepared. This new technique for the fabrication of S/W/O can not only be applied in the field of microfluidics but also in chemical/biological engineering (e.g., drug delivery, bioreactors, etc.), as well as burgeoning inter-discipline such as inertial confinement fusion (ICF) experiments.
