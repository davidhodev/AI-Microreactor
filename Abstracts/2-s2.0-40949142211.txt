We report a tri-phase microfluidic technology that can produce picoliter-sized biphasic droplets and geometrically anisotropic polymer microparticles. Using a planar sheath-flowing regime, we generated biphasic droplets comprised of two immiscible organic fluids in co-flowing aqueous phase; these droplets formed Janus or core-shell structure by the balance of interfacial tensions among three liquid phases. Subsequent photo-polymerization produced nonspherical polymer particles such as hemispheric particles, and shells with a pore on their surfaces. The size and shape of droplets and particles were controllable by varying flow conditions. A scale-up approach by multiple-channel integration was also demonstrated.
