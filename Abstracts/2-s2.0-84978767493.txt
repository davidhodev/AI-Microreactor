© Lietuvos mokslų akademija, 2016.A study of fluid flow in structured channels plays an important role in solving most fluid dynamics problems. The knowledge of the flow structure in separate cavities can be used to intensify mixing in microreactors and microelectrochemical systems (MEMS) as well as to increase heat transfer in heat sinks. Besides, knowledge about fluid flow in micro cavities could be useful to mitigate the symptoms of aneurysms. In this study, a 2D micro-particle image velocimetry (μPIV) system was used to investigate water flow in an open-type microcavity located in a straight, square cross-section (0.5 × 0.5 mm2) microchannel. Two identical micro cavities of the same cross-section as the main channel and the depth of 1 mm are oppositely located in the middle part of the channel. Because of symmetry, the flow structure of the primary vortex was investigated in only one cavity. Measurements were carried out in different planes over the entire height of the cavity at Reynolds number in the range from 100 to 3000. The flow in the channel was stationary and pulsating. Results indicate that flow in the cavity is three-dimensional. This is confirmed by velocity profile shape changes in its different transversal planes. In addition, it is determined that flow structure in the cavity depends on flow regime and flow pulsation characteristics. Velocity distribution shows that in the transverse direction there is the minimum velocity zone corresponding to the centre of the primary vortex generated by the channel flow, also the same zone is observed along the cavity in its axial plane. At low Re, such velocity distribution occurs in pulsating flow earlier than in the case of stationary flow. With increasing Re, velocity distribution in pulsating flow flattens out also more. It means that disturbed flow in the channel accelerates the formation of a stable flow structure in the cavity.
