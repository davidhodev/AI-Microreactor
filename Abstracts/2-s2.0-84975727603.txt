© 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland. The rapidly emerging industry of micro-electro-mechanical devices gives rise to new potential microfluidic applications. The analysis of the possible flow regimes is an important task of any microfluidic investigation. For a gas flow the transition between steady and unsteady regimes occurs at small Knudsen number Kn < 0.1 (Kn = ℓ0 / L, where ℓ0 is the mean free path of the gas molecules and L is the characteristic length). A continuum approach based on the Navier-Stokes-Fourier equations is applicable for this investigation. On the other side, the microfluidic application requires the problem to be investigated starting at very low Mach numbers (M = 0.1), close to incompressible regime. This makes pressure based methods very suitable for this investigation. The system of Navier-Stokes-Fourier equations is calculated numerically using pressure based algorithm SIMPLE-TS 2D. The results are validated by comparing them to data obtained by using molecular approach (direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method).
