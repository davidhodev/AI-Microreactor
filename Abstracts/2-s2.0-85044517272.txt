© 2018 Institution of Chemical Engineers Ghost Particle Velocimetry (GPV) has only been recently introduced and has already been proven useful in small scale phenomena investigations, such as the study of the flow field during single droplets generation in microfluidic devices. In this work, GPV was used to experimentally investigate fluid flow close to a T-shaped branched junction in a millimetre sized device. The experimental setup allowed for the first time, the study of complex fluid dynamic structures such as vortices and recirculation zones. Several experiments were performed to exploit the capability of GPV in carrying out flow field measurements, at different Reynolds numbers within the laminar flow regime and for two channel sizes. The results were validated by verifying the steady state and stability conditions and by comparing them with results obtained using the well-established micron-scale Particle Image Velocimetry (μPIV). Differences between these two velocimetry techniques were analysed in terms of qualitative and quantitative parameters, to attain a performance comparison and understand the strengths and weaknesses of each respective method.
