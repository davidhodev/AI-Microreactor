Emulsion droplets or multi-emulsion droplet formation was important for functional materials synthesizing by microfluidic. To obtain tunable monodisperse droplets with millimeter scale, the flow regime in co-flowing channels was divided by numerical simulation. A typical co-flowing model was created using finite volume method, and the VOF (volume of fluid) muti-phase model was selected. Then, droplets were produced by changing the velocity ratio under the dripping regime. Compared to the experimental value of droplet diameter, theoretical and numerical absolute error was below 60% and 15%, separately. Greet agreement of diameter changing tendency was found in simulation and experiment. Â© (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.
