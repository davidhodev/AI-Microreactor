A device focusing on measuring flow in the molecular flow regime through nanochannels is presented. The apparatus is based on pressure driven flow, which is important for microelectromechanical (MEMS), nanomechanical-electrical systems (NEMS) and a wide range of other applications. The device is tested in the slip flow regime, but also flow in the Knudsen regime in parallel nanochannels can be measured. Knudsen numbers at the inlet between 0.08 and 0.23 are tested experimentally in this paper and is compared with theory. In addition, the functionality for Kn >10 is also discussed, based on theoretical work. The setup had been tested for a channel with 362 ± 5 μm diameter and a length of 2 mm validating its ability to measure a wide range of flow regimes in different kind of samples. Argon gas is used for measuring the flow through the microchannel.
