Â© 2014 AIP Publishing LLC. The rapidly emerging industry of micro-electro-mechanical devices gives rise to new potential microfluidic applications. The analysis of the possible flow regimes is an important task of any microfluidic investigation. For unstable rarefied gas flows the transition between steady and unsteady regimes occurs at small Knudsen number Kn < 0.1 (Kn = l0/L, where l0 is the mean free path of the gas molecules and L is the characteristic length). The microfluidic problems include non-equilibrium effects to be taken into account. A continuum approach, based on the Navier-Stokes-Fourier equations with slip-velocity and jump-temperature boundary conditions, is applicable for this investigation. In this paper, we compare Strouhal number obtained from molecular (DSMC method) and continual (SIMPLE-TS algorithm) approach, for a flow past square in a microchannel at transition from steady to unsteady flow regime for a fixed Mach number (M = 0.4).
