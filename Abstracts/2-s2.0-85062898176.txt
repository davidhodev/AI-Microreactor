Â© 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.The electroosmotic flow of a Powell-Eyring fluid through a cylindrical microchannel activated by an electric field, taking the interfacial slip into account is presented. The study employs an analytical framework of homotopy perturbation method to obtain the underlying flow dynamics of Powell-Eyring fluid over interfacial scales. The rich physical interaction between the fluid rheology, interfacial slip and electrical forces uncovers alteration in the flow dynamics and shear stress profile for Powell-Eyring fluid. Different regimes of flow enhancement in the cylindrical microchannel, triggered by the combined effects of slipping dynamics and electrical double layer phenomena are established through the study. The present analytical framework is canonical with the numerical results for all the cases as considered in this study. The inferences obtained from the present analysis may improve the design of bio-MEMS and microfluidic devices applied for medical diagnostics and transportation of biofluids.
