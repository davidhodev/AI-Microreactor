© 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd. Microfluidic techniques for production of uniform droplets usually rely on the use of two immiscible liquids (e.g. water-in-oil emulsions). It has been shown recently that a continuous gas flow instead of a second liquid carrier can be used as an alternative approach in droplet microfluidics. In this work we experimentally investigate the generation of liquid water droplets within air in flow-focusing configurations. Over a wide range of flow conditions we identify six distinct flow regimes inside the microchannel: Co-flowing, Threading, Plugging, Dripping, Multi-Satellite Formation, and Jetting. Flow regimes and their transitions are plotted and characterized based on the Weber number (We) of the system. We further investigate the impact of liquid microchannel size on the flow maps. Generation frequency, morphology, and monodispersity of the droplets are characterized in more detail in the Dripping regime. Generation frequency can be related to the product of the liquid and gas flow rates. However, droplet morphology (length and width) is more dependent on the gas flow rate. We demonstrate the production of monodisperse droplets (d < 100 μm and σ/d < 5 %) up to kHz formation rates in liquid-gas microfluidic systems for the first time. The results of this work provide practical and useful guidelines for precise, oil-free delivery of ultra-small volumes of fluid which can be integrated in lab-on-a-chip systems for a variety of applications in biochemical research and material synthesis.
