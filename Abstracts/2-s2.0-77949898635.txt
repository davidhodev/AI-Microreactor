In this contribution we present the design, fabrication and measurement results of a novel hydrodynamically 3D adjustable lens chip fabricated by rapid prototyping. To our knowledge this is the first time a reconfigurable three-dimensional liquid- core liquid-cladding lens chip is manufactured in transparent photopolymer resin by micro laser stereolithography. The laminar flow regime in the microchannels and the application of fluids with different refractive indices enable the formation of optofluidic elements. The unique features of this optical chip offer a novel 3D light focusing system useable for optical cell detection fabricated by fast prototyping. Â© 2008 CBMS.
