In this paper, jetting behavior of two immiscible liquids, water as the outer liquid and silicone oil as the inner liquid in typical flow focusing microchannels were numerically studied using VOF method. At low capillary number, uniform microdroplets were obtained by the absolute instability. With the increasing of fluid flow ratio, the jet is thinner and tends to break up further away the cross junction. The results showed that the flow rate ratio is the main factor that influences the microdroplet sizes, while the frequency of microdroplets formation can be controlled mainly by the surface tension when it is in the jetting regime.
