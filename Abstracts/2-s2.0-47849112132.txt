This paper describes two-phase flow pattern and pressure drop characteristics during the absorption of CO2 into water in three horizontal microchannel contactors which consist of Y-type rectangular microchannels having hydraulic diameters of 667, 400 and 200 μ m, respectively. With the help of a high-speed photography system, flow patterns such as bubbly flow, slug flow (including two sub-regimes, Taylor flow and unstable slug flow), slug-annular flow, churn flow and annular flow were observed in these microchannels. The applicability of the currently available correlations for describing flow pattern transitions in microchannels has been examined. Generally, the predicting performance of these correlations deteriorates as the channel diameter further reduces. Toward solving this discrepancy, an empirical correlation based on the superficial Weber numbers was developed to interpret the transition from Taylor flow to unstable slug flow in three microchannels. Taylor bubble formation process in microchannels was found to be in the squeezing regime at lower superficial liquid velocities (Ca ranging from 0.0019 to 0.029) while the transition to the dripping regime was observed at the highest superficial liquid velocity of 1.0 m/s. Lengths of Taylor bubbles formed in the squeezing regime can be well represented by the scaling relation proposed by Garstecki et al. [Formation of droplets and bubbles in a microfluidic T-junction-scaling and mechanism of break-up. Lab on a Chip, 6, 437-446]. For flow patterns including slug-annular flow, annular flow and churn flow, a simple analysis based on the separated flow model has been performed in order to reveal the observed effect of the superficial liquid velocity on two-phase frictional multiplier in the present microchannels. Then, reasonable correlations for the prediction of two-phase frictional pressure drop under these flow patterns were suggested. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
