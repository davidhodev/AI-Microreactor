© 2018, The Author(s). Fischer–Tropsch synthesis (FTS) is a promising technology to convert syngas derived from non-petroleum-based resources to valuable chemicals or fuels. Selectively producing target products will bring great economic benefits, but unfortunately it is theoretically limited by Anderson–Schulz–Flory (ASF) law. Herein, we synthesize size-uniformed cobalt nanocrystals embedded into mesoporous SiO 2 supports, which is likely the structure of water-melon seeds inside pulps. We successfully tune the selectivity of products from diesel-range hydrocarbons (66.2%) to gasoline-range hydrocarbons (62.4%) by controlling the crystallite sizes of confined cobalt from 7.2 to 11.4 nm, and modify the ASF law. Generally, larger Co crystallites increase carbon-chain growth, producing heavier hydrocarbons. But here, we interestingly observe a reverse phenomenon: the uniformly small-sized cobalt crystallites can strongly adsorb active C* species, and the confined structure will inhibit aggregation of cobalt crystallites and escape of reaction intermediates in FTS, inducing the higher selectivity towards heavier hydrocarbons.
