Semiflexible polymers subject to hydrodynamic forcing play an important role in cytoskeletal motions in the cell, particularly when filaments guide molecular motors whose motions create flows. Near hyperbolic stagnation points, filaments experience a competition between bending elasticity and tension and are predicted to display suppressed thermal fluctuations in the extensional regime and a buckling instability under compression. Using a microfluidic cross-flow geometry, we verify these predictions in detail, including a fluctuation-rounded stretch-coil transition of actin filaments. Â© 2012 American Physical Society.
