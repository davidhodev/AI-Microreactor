For this purpose, a computational fluid dynamics analysis is used to carry out numerical simulations of the liquid flow and the mass transport around a spherical bubble in a square or a circular microchannel, for a stress-free or a rigid gas–liquid interface. The corresponding results are consolidated into correlations to calculate the bubble velocity and the interfacial rate of mass transfer as functions of the control parameters of the system. For each considered case, the flow structure, the concentration field around the bubble and the local interfacial rate of mass transfer are presented and shown to be intricately related.
