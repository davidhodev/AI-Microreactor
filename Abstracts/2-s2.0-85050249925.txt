Â© 2018 IEEE.We propose a reduced order flow chart model of a hydrogel-based micro-valve, which focuses on the implementation of pressure and flow regimes as well as swelling kinetics of hydro-gels within a micro-valve seat. As material behavior, the transient swelling and the quasi-static phase-change are demonstrated. This phase-change is triggered by a concentration level which is determined by the flow behavior of the microfluidic network. Furthermore, a library model is created and the simulation of 100 valves connected in a microfluidic network is performed simultaneously. It is aimed to create a user-friendly toolbox for hydrogel-based microfluidic circuits in Matlab Simulink which is capable of accurately predicting flow and hydrogel behaviors and improve the rapid prototyping design process for highly complex microfluidic systems.
