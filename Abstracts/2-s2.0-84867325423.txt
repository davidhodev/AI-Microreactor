Micron sized, lipid stabilized bubbles of gas are of interest as contrast agents for ultra-sound (US) imaging and increasingly as delivery vehicles for targeted, triggered, therapeutic delivery. Microfluidics provides a reproducible means for microbubble production and surface functionalisation. In this study, microbubbles are generated on chip using flow-focussing microfluidic devices that combine streams of gas and liquid through a nozzle a few microns wide and then subjecting the two phases to a downstream pressure drop. While microfluidics has successfully demonstrated the generation of monodisperse bubble populations, these approaches inherently produce low bubble counts. We introduce a new micro-spray flow regime that generates consistently high bubble concentrations that are more clinically relevant compared to traditional monodisperse bubble populations. Final bubble concentrations produced by the micro-spray regime were up to 1010 bubbles mL-1. The technique is shown to be highly reproducible and by using multiplexed chip arrays, the time taken to produce one millilitre of sample containing 10 10 bubbles mL-1 was ∼10 min. Further, we also demonstrate that it is possible to attach liposomes, loaded with quantum dots (QDs) or fluorescein, in a single step during MBs formation. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.
