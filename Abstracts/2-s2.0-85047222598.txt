Recent progress in the development of biosensors has created a demand for high-throughput sample preparation techniques that can be easily integrated into microfluidic or lab-on-a-chip platforms. One mechanism that may satisfy this demand is deterministic lateral displacement (DLD), which uses hydrodynamic forces to separate particles based on size. Numerous medically relevant cellular organisms, such as circulating tumor cells (10–15 µm) and red blood cells (6–8 µm), can be manipulated using microscale DLD devices. In general, these often-viscous samples require some form of dilution or other treatment prior to microfluidic transport, further increasing the need for high-throughput operation to compensate for the increased sample volume. However, high-throughput DLD devices will require a high flow rate, leading to an increase in Reynolds numbers (Re) much higher than those covered by existing studies for microscale (≤ 100 µm) DLD devices. This study characterizes the separation performance for microscale DLD devices in the high-Re regime (10 < Re < 60) through numerical simulation and experimental validation. As Re increases, streamlines evolve and microvortices emerge in the wake of the pillars, resulting in a particle trajectory shift within the DLD array. This differs from previous DLD works, in that traditional models only account for streamlines that are characteristic of low-Re flow, with no consideration for the transformation of these streamlines with increasing Re. We have established a trend through numerical modeling, which agrees with our experimental findings, to serve as a guideline for microscale DLD performance in the high-Re regime. Finally, this new phenomenon could be exploited to design passive DLD devices with a dynamic separation range, controlled simply by adjusting the device flow rate.
