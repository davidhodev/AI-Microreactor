The decoupled effects of Reynolds and Dean numbers are examined in inertial focusing flows. In doing so, a complex set of inertial focusing behavioral regimes is discovered within curved microfluidic channels over a range of channel Reynolds numbers, curvature ratios and particle confinement ratios. These regimes are characterized by particle migration either towards or away from the center of curvature as the channel Reynolds number is increased. The transition between these two regimes is shown to be a set of conditions where single-point equilibrium position focusing of particles of different sizes is achieved. A mechanism describing the observed motion of particles in such flows is hypothesized incorporating the redistribution of the main flow velocities caused by Dean flow and its effect on the balance forces on suspended particles.
