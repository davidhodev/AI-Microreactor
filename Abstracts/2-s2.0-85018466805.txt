The recent emergence and global implications of unconventional oil and gas production from nanoporous shale further necessitate a higher understanding of phase behavior at these scales. Here, we directly observe condensation and condensate growth of a light hydrocarbon (propane) in discrete sub-100 nm (70 nm) channels. Two different condensation mechanisms at this nanoscale are distinguished, continuous growth and discontinuous growth due to liquid bridging ahead of the meniscus, both leading to similar net growth rates. The growth rates agree well with those predicted by a suitably defined thermofluid resistance model. In contrast to phase change at larger scales (220 and 1000 nm cases), the rate of liquid condensate growth in channels of sub-100 nm size is found to be limited mainly by vapor flow resistance (70% of the total resistance here), with interface resistance making up the difference. The condensation-induced vapor flow is in the transitional flow regime (Knudsen flow accounting for up to 13% of total resistance here). Collectively, these results demonstrate that with confinement at sub-100 nm scales, such as is commonly found in porous shale and other applications, condensation conditions deviate from the microscale and larger bulk conditions chiefly due to vapor flow and interface resistances.
