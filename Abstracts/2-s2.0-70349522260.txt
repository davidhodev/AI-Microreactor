We develop two direct methods to simultaneously measure the dynamic capillary pressure and the viscosity of fluids by application of differential forces during flow into micro-channels. In the first method, a series of external pressures is applied in conjunction with the dynamic capillary pressure and a "Bagley analysis" is applied to the flow front velocity, and in the second, we utilize differential gravitational forces. By explicitly measuring the dynamic capillary pressure, the measurement window of the recently developed multi-sample micro-slit rheometer is extended to the regime where capillary forces are significant. These measurement methods will be useful in understanding filling flows encountered in diverse areas such as microfluidics, oil recovery and biological transport.
