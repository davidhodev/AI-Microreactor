Two different applications of conformal mapping approaches are proposed for the treatment of double band assemblies operating in a microfluidic channel: (i) a quasi-conformal map for the numerical simulation of diffusion-convection processes occurring when the channel is submitted to a microfluidic flow, and (ii) a conformal map specifically designed for obtaining the steady-state analytical solution for the pure diffusional regime (i.e., without flow) within the same channel. The latter applies also when such assemblies perform within a thin film of electrolyte. The results are presented for a generator-collector operation of the assemblies but the methods apply also to other situations (e.g., generator-generator mode). Â© 2004 Elsevier B.V.
