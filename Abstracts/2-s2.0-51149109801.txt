We report preliminary data from molecular and rheometric characterization to flow characterization of model fluids in benchmark flow problems, in a range of Wi number and Re number flow regimes. The experimental data will be used to critically compare numerical predictions of some well-established constitutive models. We hope to provide physical insight to polymer dynamics in highly non-linear flows, hence to improve constitutive models for a better prediction of dynamics of semi-dilute polymer solutions.
