Â© The Korean Society of Plant Pathology.Efforts to control viral diseases in crop production include several types of physical or chemical treatments; antiviral extracts of a number of plants have also been examined to inhibit plant viral infection. However, treatments utilizing naturally selected microorganisms with activity against plant viruses are poorly documented. Here we report isolation of a soil inhabiting bacterium, Pseudomonas oleovorans strain KBPF-004 (developmental code KNF2016) which showed antiviral activity against mechanical transmission of tobamoviruses. Antiviral activity was also evaluated in seed transmission of two tobamoviruses, Pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV) and Cucumber green mottle mosaic virus (CGMMV), by treatment of seed collected from infected pepper and watermelon, respectively. Pepper and watermelon seeds were treated with culture supernatant of P. oleovorans strain KBPF-004 or control strain ATCC 8062 before planting. Seeds germinated after treatment with water or ATCC 8062 yielded about 60% CGMMV or PMMoV positive plants, whereas < 20% of KBPF-004-treated seeds were virusinfected, a significantly reduced seed transmission rate. Furthermore, supernatant of P. oleovorans strain KBPF-004 remodeled aggregation of PMMoV 126 kDa protein and subcellular localization of movement protein in Nicotiana benthamiana, diminishing aggregation of the 126 kDa protein and essentially abolishing association of the movement protein with the microtubule network. In leaves agroinfiltrated with constructs expressing the coat protein (CP) of either PMMoV or CGMMV, less full-size CP was detected in the presence of supernatant of P. oleovorans strain KBPF-004. These changes may contribute to the antiviral effects of P. oleovorans strain KBPF-004.
