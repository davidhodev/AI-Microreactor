Go with the (segmented) flow: A gas-liquid microfluidic reactor system has been developed to study Pd-catalyzed carbonylation reactions over a range of flow regimes and reaction conditions (see picture). The segmented gas-liquid flow regime, in comparison to annular flow, enables reactions to be studied over longer reaction times and without the buildup of unwanted Pd particles.
