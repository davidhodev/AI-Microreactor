A compressible lattice-Boltzmann model coupled with non-equilibrium extrapolation method are adopted to simulate gas flow in microchannels at slip regime (Knâ‰¤0.1). Numerical results, including velocity profiles at outlet, pressure distributions and mass flowrates, agree well with analytical solutions and experimental results. In addition, gas flow in a 180 degree curved channel is numerically simulated. It shows that boundary layer separation is suppressed by slip velocity at the wall. In addition, mass flowrate of a curved channel is smaller than that of a straight one.
