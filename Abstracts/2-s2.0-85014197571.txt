The proceedings contain 836 papers. The topics discussed include: functional mapping of biological nano- and mesoscopic structures in complex biofluids; simple and rapid formation of 3D co-culture cell laden microstructures by using cell origami technique; origami-enabled artificial liver tissue; vertically separated anisotropic 3D collagen microchamber array; passive 'orthogonal flow mixers for homogeneous dissolution of reagents in microfluidics; viscosity independent paper microfluidic imbibition; high-resolution monitoring of liquid filling in microfluidics using capacitance measurements and longitudinal electrodes; a toolkit of thread-based, microfluidic, pH sensor, electronic for medical diagnostics; measurement of blood viscosities in a wide shear rate regime using a microfluidic sensor with multiple channel arrays connected in series; and three-dimensional pancreatic islet-on-a-chip to investigate flow effects on islet survival and function.
