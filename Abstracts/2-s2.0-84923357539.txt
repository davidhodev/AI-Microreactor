Â© 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.In this work, we present the design, fabrication and characterization of a silicon-based device dedicated for activation of biological solution under dynamic and static flow regimes by fluid mixing using acoustic low-frequency vibrations. The acoustic vibrations are generated by a bulk piezoelectric lead-zirconate-titanate (PZT). In the dynamic flow regime, biological compounds (as antibodies) were used in order to build immunochips taking advantages from the remarkable properties of such acoustic device to optimize the efficiency of Abs grafting onto chemically functionalized chip. The evaluation of the performance of the system to mix and activate fluids is presented. The experiments show the mixing capacity of the device in static and dynamic flow regimes using colored water and a biological model respectively.
