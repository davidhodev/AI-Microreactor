Electroosmotic flow in microfluidic systems is limited to the low Reynolds number regime. As a result species mixing in the microchannel is inherently diffusion dominated, requiring both a long mixing channel and retention time to attain a homogeneous solution. In this paper we apply an external transverse electric field on the two-dimension microchannel, and discuss the influence of the intensity of the transverse electric field, the arrangement of the micro electrode, and the zeta potential on the micromixing. The results show that the method can effectively increase the mixing efficiency. Increasing the external transverse electric field and the density of the micro electrode can increase the mixing efficiency obviously. The lower zeta potential leads to the better micromixing effect.
