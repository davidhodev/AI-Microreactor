Due to their enormous potential, microfluidic technologies have emerged as an advanced approach for the development of drug delivery systems with well-defined physicochemical characteristics and in a reproducible manner. Areas covered: This review provides an overview of microfluidic devices and materials used for their manufacturing, together with the flow patterns and regimes commonly used for nanoparticle preparation. Additionally, the different geometries used in droplet microfluidics are reviewed, with particular attention to the co-flow geometry used for the production of nanoparticles. Finally, this review summarizes the main and most recent nanoparticulate systems prepared using microfluidics, including drug nanosuspensions, polymeric, lipid, structured, and theranostic nanoparticles. Expert opinion: The production of nanoparticles at industrial scale is still a challenge, but the microfluidic technologies bring exciting opportunities to develop drug delivery systems that can be engineered in an easy, cost-effective and reproducible manner. As a highly interdisciplinary research field, more efforts and general acceptance are needed to allow for the translation of nanoparticulate drug delivery systems from academic research to the clinical practice.
