The micrometric devices are present in various industrial manufacturing processes (such as microfilters), medical tools (micro pumps for instance) and in measuring instruments. In order to describe the gas flows in microchannels involved in these systems, the DSMC methods are very well adapted but they are expensive in computation time [1, 2]. Consequently, it is of main interest to develop asymptotic models describing these flows. In this contribution, our purpose is to model the flow of a mixture of two compressible gases in microchannels. We are interested in flows at low Mach numbers and with low to moderate Knudsen numbers so that the flow is in the slip regime. Â© 2012 American Institute of Physics.
