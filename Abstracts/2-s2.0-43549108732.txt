To date, no published study has examined quantitatively the effect of geometric and dimensional idealization on prediction of the mechanical signals imparted by fluid drag to cell surfaces. We hypothesize that this idealization affects the magnitude and range of imparted forces predicted to occur at a subcellular level. Hence, we used computational fluid dynamics to predict magnitudes and spatial variation of fluid velocity and pressure, as well as shear stress, on the cell surface in two- and three-dimensional models of actual and idealized pericellular canalicular geometries. Furthermore, variation in actual pericellular space dimensions was analyzed statistically based on high-resolution transmitted electron micrographs (TEM). Accounting for the naturally occurring protrusions of the pericellular space delineating lamina limitans resulted in predictions of localized stress spikes on the cell surface, up to five times those predicted using idealized geometries. Predictions accounting for actual pericellular geometries approached those required to trigger cell activity in in vitro models. Furthermore, statistical analysis of TEM-based dimensions showed significant variation in the width of the canalicular space as well as the diameter of the cell process, both of which decrease with increasing distance from the cell body. For the first time to our knowledge, this study shows the influence of physiologic geometry per se on the nano-scale flow regimes in bone, and the profound influence of physiologic geometry on force magnitudes and variations imparted locally to cells through load-induced fluid flow.
