Transparent and planar meso-scale fluidic structures with no movable parts, based on feedback microfluidic oscillators, were manufactured in acrylic (using a computer numerically controlled milling machine) and sealed using thermo-compressive bonding. Internal flow images for the operation with water were analyzed considering supply flows in the range of 60 ml/min to 600 ml/min. Tracers with different viscosities were injected (continuously or in a pulsed way) to improve contrast. Depending on the constriction dimensions at the output of the feedback arms, these structures can present different behaviors associated with momentum interaction, and can be used for different applications. Smaller constrictions lead to structures that oscillate in any flow regime (1000 < Re < 10,000) while larger ones avoid oscillation but favor retention of fluid inside the feedback arms.
