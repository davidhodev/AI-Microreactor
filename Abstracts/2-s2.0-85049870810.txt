© 2018 Author(s).Flow and transport within porous- and microtextured-walled channels is relevant to a number of natural and industrial processes. Designing and optimizing the topology of the pores and/or microstructure to achieve target performance at the system scale (or macroscale) is still an open question. In this work, we study whether hydrodynamic dispersion in microfluidic channels with walls structured by obstacles can be modeled by dispersion in channels with porous walls described as continuous porous media of zero or finite permeability. We perform single phase microfluidic non-reactive flow experiments in channels embedded in micropatterns with different topologies. Specifically, we focus on transverse riblets and arrays of pillars as examples of impermeable and permeable obstructions, respectively. We compare the experimental results with three models: 3D pore-scale simulations which resolve the micropattern geometry explicitly and two upscaled models which treat the micropattern as a continuum of zero or finite permeability. This study demonstrates that polydimethylsiloxane micromodels with appropriately patterned surfaces can be successfully employed to validate various continuum-scale modeling approximations in different physical regimes, identified by the order of magnitude of the Péclet number and the obstruction permeability.
