In recent years, microfluidic devices that generate micron sized droplets/bubbles have found widespread applications in drug delivery, microanalysis, tumor destruction, as ultrasound agents and in chemical reactions at the micron level. In the current work, simulations results are being presented for a Tjunction device for the formation of micron-sized droplets using the lattice Boltzmann method. Flow regimes obtained as a consequence of two immiscible fluids interacting at a Tjunction are presented for a range of Capillary numbers and different flow rates of the continuous and dispersed phases. Through lattice Boltzmann based simulations, regime maps are presented that distinguish parallel flows from droplet flows. It is shown that as the Capillary number increases, the transition zone which separates parallel and droplet flows shrinks, and is influenced by the viscosity ratio as well.
