The development of any particular analytical or preparative applications using electrochemical techniques in microfluidic devices requires integration of microelectrodes. This involves detailed predictions for optimizing the design of devices and selecting the best hydrodynamic conditions. For this purpose, we undertook a series of works aimed at a precise investigation of mass transport near electrodes with focus on analytical measurements. Part I of this series (Anal. Chem. 2007, 79, 8502-8510) evaluated the common case of a single microband electrode embedded within a microchannel under laminar flow. The present work (Part 2) investigated the case of a pair of microband electrodes operating either in generator-generator or generator-collector modes. The influence of the confining effect and flow velocity on the amperometric responses was examined on the basis of numerical simulations under steady-state regime. Several situations were identified, each of them corresponding to specific interactions taking place between the electrodes. Related conditions were extracted to establish a zone diagram describing all the situations. These predictions were systematically validated by experimental measurements. The results show that amperometric detections within microchannels can be performed at dual electrodes with higher analytical performances than at single ones. Â© 2008 American Chemical Society.
