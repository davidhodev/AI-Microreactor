The objective of this study was to characterize the practices of pesticide use and management in horticultural crops in this region and the risk they entail to health and the environment. The study was carried out during 2015 in the Comarca Lagunera of Coahuila and Durango, Mexico. A stratified random sampling system was used with a 95 % confidence interval, a bias of ± 5 % and a sample size of 90 surveys applied to vegetable producers. The vegetables with the largest area planted were, in descending order, melon, watermelon, pepper and tomato. Organophosphorus pesticides were the most used, applied by 65.7 % of the population surveyed, The active ingredient with the largest application was carbofuran with 42 %. Only 40 % of producers have received training on the proper use and management of agrochemicals and 75 % of producers do not have personal protection equipment. Sixty one percent of the producers leave the containers in the field or burn them after use and 34 % have suffered pesticide poisoning at least once. Training is sporadic and the advanced average age of the producers increases the environmental risk and health by the use of these agrochemicals.
