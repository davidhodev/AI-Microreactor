Improving such measurements (especially in contexts that require continuous monitoring) is challenging because of constraints associated with shrinking system geometries and limitations imposed by making precise measurements of smaller quantities in real time. A particularly interesting limit is the relative uncertainty as flow approaches zero, which diverges for most measurement methods. To address these problems, we have developed an optofluidic measurement system that can deliver and record light in a precise interrogation region of a microfluidic channel. The system utilizes photobleaching of fluorophore dyes in the bulk flow and can identify zero flow to better than 1 nL/min absolute accuracy. The technique also provides an independent method for determining nonzero flow rates based on a robust scaling relationship between the fluorescence emission and flow. Together, these two independent approaches enable precise measurement of flow to within 5% accuracy down to 10 nL/min and validation of flow control to within 5% uncertainty down to 2 nL/min. We also demonstrate that our technique can be used to extend a calibrated flow meter well below its specified range (e.g., 500 nL/min) and to make dynamic measurements of similar relative uncertainties to the calibrated meter, which would have otherwise expanded significantly in this regime.
