Bead based assays require the essential steps of particle mixing, segregation, and extraction. In droplet microfluidics, particle concentration techniques typically require either electrical or magnetic fields together with charged or magnetic particles. Here we present a passive, on-chip particle mixing, segregation, and extraction technique based on the interaction between naturally occurring hydrodynamic recirculating flows and particle sedimentation within the plug. The interaction can be quantified using the Shields number (θ), a dimensionless ratio of a particle's drag force to its gravitational force, which scales with plug velocity. Depending on θ, three distinct flow regimes can be defined, and the key steps of particle segregation and resuspension can be performed simply by changing flow velocity. We demonstrate highly efficient concentration (∼100%) of 38 μm glass beads in 200 and 500 μm diameter plugs traveling at velocities up to 5 mm/s. Segregated particles are then extracted using a transverse drop splitter. This technique expands the capabilities of plug-based microfluidics to perform particle filtration without on-chip components and thereby could be applied to bead-based screening assays.
