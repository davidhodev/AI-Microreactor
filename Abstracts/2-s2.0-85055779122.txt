Channels with widths in the tens of micrometer range are referred to as microfluidic devices. Fluidic behavior at the microscale may differ from that at larger scales in that interfacial tension, viscous effects, and energy dissipation can dominate the system. Microfluidics has received much attention in the scientific community and many excellent reviews have been published [1,2]. A key advantage of microfluidics is the ability to perform experiments and bioassays using miniscule quantities of solution. This provides an economic benefit and is important for certain biosensing applications, experiments requiring single-molecule interrogation (e.g., deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequencing [3,4]), or diffusion-limited regimes. Another benefit is that rapid measurements of these minute quantities can be performed with miniaturized analytical systems [5–7]. In some applications slow or minimal mixing is required, and the laminar flows obtained in microchannels become highly desirable. Water-in-oil emulsions can be formed in microfluidic devices to form a steady stream of monodisperse aqueous droplets with volumes as small as picoliters [8]. The drops can be loaded with reactants to perform chemical reactions of interest [9].
