It is widely predicted that various aspects of nanotechnology applied to microstructure technology will find increasing use in biotechnology and medicine and result in a more widespread use of such ideas. Thus microfluidics chips serve as platforms in nanobiotechnology and as an interface for users of the technology while nanotechnology can expand the range of functions available using biochips. Examples include nanoparticles, nanobarcodes, nanopores, molecular imprint technology and nano-coatings. Before such concepts can be fully exploited, further development work is necessary in terms of flow behaviour and mass-transport in these very small structures. As flow cross-sections decrease, a drastic chahge in hydrodynamic regime is observed, including the fact that the cross-section of a micro-channel is dimensionally of the same order as the boundary layer thickness found in macroscopic conditions.
