We investigate the role of interfacial slip on evaporation of a thin liquid film in a microfluidic channel. The effective slip mechanism is attributed to the formation of a depleted layer adhering to the substrate-fluid interface, either in a continuum or in a rarefied gas regime, as a consequence of intricate hydrophobic interactions in the narrow confinement. We appeal to the fundamental principles of conservation in relating the evaporation mechanisms with fluid flow and heat transfer over interfacial scales. We obtain semi-analytical solutions of the pertinent governing equations, with coupled heat and mass transfer boundary conditions at the liquid-vapor interface. We observe that a general consequence of interfacial slip is to elongate the liquid film, thereby leading to a film thickening effect. Thicker liquid films, in turn, result in lower heat transfer rates from the wall to liquid film, and consequently lower mass transfer rates from the liquid film to the vapor phase. Nevertheless, the total mass of evaporation (or equivalently, the net heat transfer) turns out to be higher in case of interfacial slip due to the longer film length. We also develop significant physical insights on the implications of the relative thickness of the depleted layer with reference to characteristic length scales of the microfluidic channel on the evaporation process, under combined influences of the capillary pressure, disjoining pressure, and the driving temperature differential for the interfacial transport.
