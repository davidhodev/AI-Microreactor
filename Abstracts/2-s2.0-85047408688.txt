The study reports the use of surface modified ZnS nanoparticles as potential adsorbent for the removal of methylene blue (MB) from aqueous solution. The surface of the ZnS nanoparticles was modified with EDTA (E-ZnS) and watermelon rind extract (W-ZnS) and later characterized for its surface properties. The size of surface modified ZnS nanoparticles was found to be spherical shape with an average size of 12 and 10 nm, respectively, for W-ZnS and E-ZnS NPs. As an application, the ZnS nanoparticles were investigated for the sequestration of MB from aqueous solution. Batch adsorption studies were employed to optimize the experimental conditions aiming MB removal. Batch parameters such as pH, contact time, adsorbent dose and initial adsorbate concentration were optimized. Isotherms and kinetic models were applied to study the mechanism of adsorption process. The process is found to be thermodynamically feasible and spontaneous in nature. The results suggest that the surface modification of ZnS nanoparticles enhanced the MB uptake capacity.
