Â© 2003 IEEE.The in-plane digitalization of the multiphase microfluid is presented in low Reynolds number flow regime. It is achieved by manipulation of the pitch of the alternate microfluid flow and the delay distance resulting form hydrodynamics in special microchannels. The theoretical analysis derives delay distance. For the experimental evaluation, a characteristic in-plane microchannel is fabricated. Specifically, digital sorting is attempted by introducing two immiscible fluids. Also, we examine digital lamination of two miscible fluids. Finally, the digitalization is characterized qualitatively and qualitatively by using micro-PIV measurement. The short diffusion path and large contact surface obtained from digital lamination is applicable to chemical and biochemical reaction.
