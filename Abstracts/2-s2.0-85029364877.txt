© 2017 IEEE.The bladeless turbine was demonstrated by Nichola Tesla in 1913, though limited by its difficulty to maintain laminar flow between rotor disks and a lack of applications for the characteristically smooth flow outputs. These aforementioned limits are addressable by scaling to the microfluidic flow regime. Demonstrated here is a microscale Tesla pump designed and fabricated using a Digital Light Processing (DLP) based 3D printer. The miniaturized pump is characterized by low Reynolds number of 1000 and a flow rate of up to 12.6 mL/min at 1200 rpm, outputting 53 μW pump power. Coupling to a Tesla-valve based mixer network, the combination represents an all Tesla-inspired microfluidics system, Figure 1.
