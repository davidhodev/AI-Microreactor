Microsystems for the transport of gas are used in various fields. A precise measurement of the encountered microflows is necessary, in order to valid one model or the other for the boundary conditions, notably in the slip-flow regime, as well as to test new microsystems. In this paper, a new experimental setup is described. Its main advantage, compared with the setups presented in the literature, is the simultaneous double measurement of the flow, upstream and downstream from the microsystem. This double measurement points out several technical difficulties, which are not detectable by conventional devices. Our first experimental data, relative to circular microtubes, about a few tenths of microns in diameter, are presented and discussed. © 2001 éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SAS.
