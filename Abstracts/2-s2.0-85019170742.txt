Monodisperse droplet generation in microfluidic devices has large engineering applications such as in drug encapsulation and food industry. Monodispersity of the droplets in a microdevice is of engineering interest. Non-Newtonian fluids also have a wide range of applications in microfluidic devices whose monodispersity in droplet generation devices has not been studied thoroughly yet. This is an important feature in several applications such as in lab on a chip, food processing, and pharmaceutical applications. In the present study, non-Newtonian droplet generation in a co-flow device is investigated numerically. Xanthan gum solutions and water are used as the dispersed phase fluid. The simulations are performed with considering the effect of dispersed phase viscosity and continuous phase velocity on the droplet formation process. It was found that monodispersity can be achieved when non-Newtonian fluids are used as the dispersed phase in a co-flow device. The effect of varying different parameters on establishing monodispersity was investigated. The results showed that in the jetting regime, the volumes of the droplets are less dependent on the viscosity of the dispersed phase, and the flow rate of the continuous phase has a more significant effect on droplets.
