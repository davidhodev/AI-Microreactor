Microfluidics is an emerging multidisciplinary field that has the potential to provide solutions to many of the current challenges in managing head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Treatment strategies for this disease are often complex and associated with significant morbidity and mortality; furthermore, prediction of response to treatment remains inaccurate. Microfluidic technology allows a small sample of tumor to be maintained alive ex vivo within a microenvironment that mimics the in vivo milieu; the response of this tumor biopsy to treatment regimens can subsequently be investigated. Microfluidics is the science and technology of systems that process or manipulate microliter to nanoliter volumes of fluids in purpose-built devices fabricated from glass or other biocompatible polymers. The technology also involves miniaturization and integration of various laboratory procedures into novel analysis devices. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of microfluidic devices and discuss potential applications in HNSCC management. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
