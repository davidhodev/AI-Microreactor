Bicolored polymeric microspheres for particle-based displays were engineered in a microfluidic device using sheath flow geometry. Preparation of bichromal beads was accomplished by rapid formation of bicolored microdrops at a sheath-flow junction in a glass microdevice and subsequent polymerization. The size of the spheres could be varied in the range 50-190 um by changing the parameters of the aqueous/organic streams in the microchannels, giving highly monodisperse spheres with less than 5% variation. Futhermore, in order to increase the productivity, multiple channels having similar dimensions were integrated on a quartz chip by lithographic technique. We confirmed that bicolored drops of uniform size could be reliably obtained at each of the multiple junctions. The resulting spheres could be rotated to display images between a set of planar ITO electrodes by applying suitable voltages. The relation between the symmetry in flow regimes and the color distribution in droplets was also studied.
