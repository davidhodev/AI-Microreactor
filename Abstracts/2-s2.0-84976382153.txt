© 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.Two microfluidic transistors for analog flow control and amplification for lab-on-a-chip applications are presented. The transistors are based on the elastic membrane microchannel, where the flow in the microchannel between the substrate and the membrane is controlled by the pressure differences along the channel and across the membrane. Reduced-order models that capture the low-inertia dynamic behavior of the coupled fluid–structure interaction were developed to enable fast small-signal analysis of large circuits. The accuracy of the models is assessed by comparing to numerical simulations of the coupled fluid–structure interaction problem. Analog behavior (based on analytical modeling and numerical simulation) of the two devices is characterized in terms of dependence of the volume flow rate on the source–drain and gate–source pressure differences, analogous to the characterization of MOSFET operation. The characteristic curves are then used to extract the small-signal parameters (transconductance and intrinsic output resistance), characterizing the dynamic response to small time-varying pressures at the gate and/or drain. The characterization enabled identification of the various static and dynamic operation regimes of the devices, including the transistive regime where the device operates as amplifier, and the capacitive (positive and negative) regimes. Finally, the dual-membrane transistor is used to showcase its use as a diode and a common-source amplifier in the design of a micropump that, in turn, is used for mixing of two species using pulsating flows.
