The majority of carbon nanotubes' synthesis processes occur in the presence of fluid (liquid, gas, plasma, or multi-phase flow) that may function as a carrier of catalyst particles, feedstock of carbon, and the heating or cooling agent. The fluid motion defines the temperature of catalyst particles and the local chemical composition of the fluid that determines the success of synthesis of high-purity nanotubes. In this review paper, the laser ablation process, high-pressure carbon oxide process, and chemical vapor deposition process are considered from the prospective of fluid dynamics modeling. The multi-model approach should be used for concurrent rendering of different areas of computational domain by different models and/or different time steps for the same model. For multiple plume ejection in laser ablation, the near-target area could be rendered by molecular dynamics approach whereas continuous gas dynamics algorithms should be employed to simulate plume dynamics of previously ejected plumes apart of the target. Such an approach combines continuous mechanics of multi-species flow of feedstock gas or plume; micro-fluidic flow model that is needed to find heat and mass transfer rate to catalysts in presence of individual nanotubes in close proximity to each other; and molecular dynamics of evaporation and ejection of plume in laser ablation.
