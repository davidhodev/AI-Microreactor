© 2017 IPEM Thread-based microfluidics has recently seen considerable developments in the domain of portable diagnostic systems, smart bandages and tissue engineering. Similarly to paper-based microfluidics, thread-based microfluidics uses the wicking of fibers to move fluids. It has the advantage of confining and guiding the fluid along the yarns in a one, two or three dimensional space. A global approach to the motion of fluids in yarns and fiber bundles has already been reported in the literature based on the Lucas–Washburn–Rideal law. However no detailed investigation of the flow pattern inside the bundle has been conducted, depending on the internal structure of the bundle. Especially when the bundle possesses heterogeneous wetting properties, such as two different wetting regions interior and exterior, different flow patterns may exist. In this work, we perform a theoretical and numerical analysis of the different flow regimes for homogenous and heterogeneous fiber bundles. It is demonstrated that a limited number of fibers is sufficient for thread-based capillary flows, and that a caging of the flow can be achieved by realizing a lyophobic envelope.
