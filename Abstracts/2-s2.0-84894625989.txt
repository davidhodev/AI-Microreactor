The hollow cathode (HC) is currently used in Kaufmann type ion thrusters as both a discharge current source and as an ion beam neutralizer. Trends toward building small spacecraft necessitate the development of small hollow cathodes for operation both in the traditional manner (spot mode) and as stand-alone thrusters (plume mode). While some analysis of the plasma discharge based on limited experimental data exists, comparatively little is currently understood about the plasma discharge that occurs within the HC. Many physical processes occur within the discharge and during its initialization. A parallel numerical code capable of modeling the neutral gas dynamics within the hollow cathode has been developed. Further analysis of micro hollow cathode fluid behavior is presented here. The Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method is used because our previous research has shown that the gas dynamic regime of the propellant is often rarefied - the DSMC makes no continuum assumptions. This is particularly important for the microfluidic regime encountered in the case of the micro hollow cathode; while it has been found that the flow is rarefied for the downstream section of a full-scale hollow cathode, the flow in proposed smaller hollow cathodes is non-continuum throughout. Results characterizing the microfluidic gas environments encountered are analyzed and discussed. Comparison to thrust measurement experiments is made. The numerical code is demonstrated as a tool for examining the effects of changes in the hollow cathode geometry, and how the alterations relate to the micro gas dynamics. Â© 2003 by Francis T.A.
