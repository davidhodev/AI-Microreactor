Gaseous flow through a microchannel is treated numerically and analytically in order to assess pressure and mass flow losses due to a constriction of a finite length. Numerical modeling of two-dimensional (2-D) microchannel flow in the slip and transitional regimes is carried out using the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method. The prediction of pressure losses and mass flow based on a simple analytic model for constriction microchannel flow are found to be in excellent agreement with DSMC simulations. Constriction has a dramatic effect on pressure loss and mass flow rate for the considered cases. The DSMC results indicate that the flow in the constriction microchannel separates in the transition section, but the separation does not significantly impact pressure distributions. Â© 2005 IEEE.
