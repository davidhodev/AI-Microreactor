Effective and fast mixing is important for many microfluidic applications. In many cases, mixing is limited by molecular diffusion due to constrains of the laminar flow in the microscale regime. According to scaling law, decreasing the mixing path can shorten the mixing time and enhance mixing quality. One of the techniques for reducing mixing path is sequential segmentation. This technique divides solvent and solute into segments in axial direction. The so-called Taylor-Aris dispersion can improve axial transport by three orders of magnitudes. The mixing path can be controlled by the switching frequency and the mean velocity of the flow. Mixing ratio can be controlled by pulse width modulation of the switching signal. This paper first presents a simple time-dependent one-dimensional analytical model for sequential segmentation. The model considers an arbitrary mixing ratio between solute and solvent as well as the axial Taylor-Aris dispersion. Next, a micromixer was designed and fabricated based on polymeric micromachining. The micromixer was formed by laminating four polymer layers. The layers are micro machined by a CO2 laser. Switching of the fluid flows was realized by two piezoelectric valves. Mixing experiments were evaluated optically. The concentration profile along the mixing channel agrees qualitatively well with the analytical model. Furthermore, mixing results at different switching frequencies were investigated. Due to the dynamic behavior of the valves and the fluidic system, mixing quality decreases with increasing switching frequency. Â© Springer Science + Business Media, LLC 2006.
