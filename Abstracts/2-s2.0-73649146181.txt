A novel targeted application of tissue engineering is the development of an in vitro 3D tissue model for drug screening and toxicology. This paper discusses the modeling, design, and freeform fabrication of 3D cell-embedded tissue constructs for creating a pharmacokinetic model. This is achieved using a combinatorial setup involving a CAD-driven automated syringe-based, layered direct cell writing process in conjunction with soft lithographic micro-patterning techniques. This enables the rational design of a microscale in vitro device housing a bioprinted 3D tissue construct (or micro-organ) that biomimics the cell's physiological microenvironment for enhanced functionality. This paper specifically addresses issues related to the development and implementation of a unique direct cell writing process for biofabrication of 3D cell-encapsulated hydrogel-based tissue constructs with defined patterns, the direct integration onto a microfluidic device, and the perfusion of the 3D tissue constructs for pharmacokinetic study. Micron-sized features enables the achievement of large hydrodynamic shear forces on our tissue constructs while preserving predictable laminar flow regimes. It has been demonstrated in literature that these shear stresses serve as mechanical stimuli which cells mechanotransduce to influence drug response. The motivation for the design and modeling of the bioprinted flow pattern is to predict, tune, and optimize the metabolic drug response of 3D bio-printed liver tissue to hydrodynamic perturbations under varying experimental flow conditions and structural flow patterns.
