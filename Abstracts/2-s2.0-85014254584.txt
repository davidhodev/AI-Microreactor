Blood aggregation occurs when erythrocytes, red blood cells (RBC), agglutinate together into compact stacks of cells called rouleaux. Blood aggregation can then be compared to a liquid-gel transition that appears at low flow regime, and is responsible of the high value of the blood viscosity at low shear rate. This paper will present a physical device that can detect the appearing of this liquidgel transition using the transmission and reflection properties of ultrasonic waves.
