We investigate the preconcentration profiles of a fluorescein and bovine serum albumin derivatized with this fluorescent tag in a microfluidic chip bearing a nanoslit. A new preconcentration method in which a hydrodynamic pressure is added to both electroosmotic and electrophoretic contributions is proposed to monitor the location of the preconcentration frontline. A simple predictive model of this pressure-assisted electropreconcentration is proposed for the evolution of the flow profile along this micro/nano/microfluidic structure. We show with a small analyte such as fluorescein that the additional hydrostatic pressure mode enables to stabilize the concentration polarization (CP) effect, resulting in better control of the cathodic focusing (CF) peak. For BSA (bovine serum albumin), we exhibit that the variation of the hydrodynamic pressure can have an even more drastic effect on the preconcentration. We show that, depending on this hydrodynamic pressure, the preconcentration can be chosen, either in the cathodic side or in the anodic one. For the first time, we prove here that both anodic focusing (AF) and cathodic focusing (CF) regimes can be reached in the same structures. These results also open new routes for the detection and the quantification of low abundance biomarkers. Â© 2013 American Chemical Society.
