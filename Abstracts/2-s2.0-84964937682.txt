© 2016 Elsevier B.V..Comparative study between foams made of a pH sensitive surfactant, nonaoxyethylene oleylether carboxylic acid (AKYPO® RO 90 VG) and a classical foaming surfactant, sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) was realised using simple microfluidic devices in the scope of Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR). The influence of injecting fluid parameters such as gas and foaming liquid pressure was investigated and discussed in terms of foam morphology, and lamellae stability and curvature radii. The increasing stability of AKYPO® foam film lamellae by increasing pH is classically explained by the electrostatic repulsive interaction of the double layer in foam film. In other hand, the addition of dodecanol (DOH) on SDS solution seems to have no effect on foam regime and lamellae stability except for high DOH concentration where the foam film shape becomes double bump. The behaviour difference between AKYPO® and SDS lays on the lamellae shape and stability domain. While SDS lamellae stay unchanged with increasing pressure ratio between the gas and the liquid, AKYPO® lamellae curvature radius increases which could be related to surfactants solubilities and structure. These results pointed out the relevance of solution physicochemical parameters on foam stability and flowing and help the understanding of flowing foam in EOR context.
