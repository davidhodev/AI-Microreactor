The former technology constructs pore and/or pore network proxies on compact lab-on-a-chip devices and investigates the impact of specifically tuned geometric and or material variable(s) on fluid transport via direct observation with microscopy. This paper reviews micro/nanofluidics findings by the authors and other geoscience and general porous media researchers related to the impacts of pore size, surface chemistry (wettability), fluid type and composition, and surface texture (roughness) on fluid transport variables such as effective viscosity, imbibition, capillary trapping, adsorption, and diffusive processes. For example, the authors’ microfluidic findings include the presence of a critical surface roughness value beyond which capillary trapping during imbibition increases drastically due to changes in subpore-scale flow regimes. The authors’ nanofluidic findings in silica nanochannels include that the polarity of a fluid and the surface chemistry of a nanoconfinement can lead to an additional contact line friction that causes significant deviations from the continuum Washburn equation for imbibition; these effects can potentially be incorporated through an increased effective viscosity. Finally, this review highlights practical approaches for utilizing lab-on-a-chip devices and their associated pore-scale findings as diagnostic tools to augment petrophysical lab measurements and guide field-scale pilot operations.
