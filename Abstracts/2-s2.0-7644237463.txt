Coupling low-flow analytical separation instrumentation such as capillary electrophoresis, capillary electrochromatography, nano-HPLC, and microfluidic-based devices with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry has yielded powerful analytical tools. However, conventional coupling methodologies such as nanospray suffer from limitations including poor conductive coating robustness, constant clogging, complicated fabrication processes, and incompatibility with large flow rate regimes. This study demonstrates that robust nanospray emitters can be fabricated through the formation and utilization of a porous polymer monolith (PPM) at the end of a fused-silica capillary. Stable electrosprays can be produced from capillaries (75-100-Î¼m i.d.) at a variety of flow rates (50-1000 nL/ min) without the need to taper the capillaries by etching or pulling. The PPM is photopatterned to be present only near the capillary exit aperture using conditions that generate pore sizes similar to those seen with nanospray tips. The porous nature of the PPM aids in developing a stable electrospray generating a single clearly visible Taylor cone at relatively high flow rates while at low flow rates (<100 nL/min) a mist, presumably from multiple small Taylor cones, develops. The hydrophobic nature of the PPM should limit problems with band broadening associated with droplet spreading at the capillary exit, while the multiple flow paths inherent in the PPM minimize clogging problems associated with conventional nanospray emitters. Total ion current traces for a constant infusion of standard PPG and cytochrome c solutions are very stable with deviations ranging from only 3 to 8%. The PPM-assisted electrospray produces mass spectra with excellent signal-to-noise ratios from only a few femtomoles of material.
