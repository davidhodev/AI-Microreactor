We have considered a homogeneously aligned liquid crystal (HALC) microvolume, confined between two infinitely long horizontal coaxial cylinders subjected to both a temperature gradient ∇T and radially applied electric field E. We have investigated dynamic field pumping, i.e. studied the interaction between director, velocity, electric fields, as well as, a radially applied temperature gradient, where the inner cylinder is kept at a lower temperature than the outer one. Flexoelectric polarization P has been taken into account as well, and modeled via the classical Meyer treatment. In order to elucidate the role of ∇T, E, and P in producing hydrodynamic flow, we have carried out a numerical study of a system of hydrodynamic equations including director reorientation, fluid flow, and temperature redistribution across the HALC cavity. Calculations show that there exists a range of parameter values (voltage and curvature of the inner cylinder) producing a kinklike orientation process in the system, as well as a nonstandard pumping regime with maximum flow near the hot cylinder. © 2010 American Institute of Physics.
