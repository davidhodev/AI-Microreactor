© 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd. Supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO 2 ) is often used to replace harmful solvents and can dissolve a wide range of organic compounds. With a favorable critical point at 31 °C and 7.4 MPa, reaching above the critical point for scCO 2 is fairly accessible. Because of the compressible nature of scCO 2 and the large changes of viscosity and density with temperature and pressure, there is a need to determine the behavior of scCO 2 in microfluidic systems. Here, the influence of how parameters such as flow rate, temperature, pressure, and flow ratio affects the length of parallel flow of water and scCO 2 and the length of the created CO 2 segments are investigated and modeled using multivariate data analysis for a 10 mm long double-y channel. The parallel length and segment size were observed in the laminar regime around and above the critical point of CO 2 . The flow ratio between the two fluids together with the flow rate influenced both the parallel length and the segment sizes, and a higher pressure resulted in shorter parallel lengths. Regarding the segment length of CO 2 , longer segments were a result of a higher Weber number for H 2 O together with a higher temperature in the channel.
