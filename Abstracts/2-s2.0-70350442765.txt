In this study, we incorporated mixing units of three-dimensional (3D) interconnected pore network inside microfluidic channels by combining single prism holographic lithography and photolithography. 3D pore network structures were generated by the interference of four laser beams generated by a truncated triangular pyramidal prism. The levelling between the 3D porous structures and the channel walls was greatly improved by employing supercritical drying, which induced negligible internal capillary stresses and reduced substantially anisotropic volume shrinkage of 3D structures. Also, complete sealing of the microfluidic chips was achieved by attaching flexible PDMS cover substrates. Overall mixing performance of the systems with completely sealed mixing units was 84% greater than that obtained without such mixers. Splitting and recombination of flows in the 3D interconnected pore structures enhanced the mixing efficiency by decreasing the diffusion path and increasing the surface contact between two liquid streams. Because the flow splitting and recombination was developed through the 3D interconnected pore network, high mixing efficiency (>0.60) was achieved at low Reynolds numbers (Re < 0.05) and Péclet numbers in the regime of Pe < 1.4 × 103. © 2009 The Royal Society of Chemistry.
