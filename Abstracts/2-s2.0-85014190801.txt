A microfluidic sensor having multiple channel arrays connected in series is proposed to measure viscosities of the blood. Since the shear rates for each array in the sensor are generated differently, viscosities at various shear rates can be obtained with a single flow rate condition. The functionality of the proposed sensor is demonstrated by both numerical and experimental studies. Results from the studies show good agreement with the reference data (less than 10.8 % in normalized deviation).
