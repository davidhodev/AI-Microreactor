Contemporary optical effects and photonic component necessary for the realization of nanoscale integrated photonic circuit for developing lab-on-a-chipincluding light sources, detectors and filters is summarized. We present the concept of a lab-on-a-chip for the next generation optoelectronics and biophotonic industry including novel nanoscale material systems for lasers and detectors. Using principles such as plasmonics and near-field optics highly efficient nanophotonic lasers or modulators can be realized. The light source can be tuned from the UV to the visible range using ion implantation of noble metal such as Ag or Au in Silicon or silica. The presence of Ag or Ag nanoparticles can result in a significant enhancement of the light emission in the UV, green or red wavelength regime. Novel molecular electronics materials has been used to design olegonucleotide based photodetectors on transparent substrates for the detection of analytes in an all-optical system. Either a transparent GaN semiconductor or glass can be used as an substrate. Hybrid photonic crystal based microfluidic channels synthesized using hydrogel material can be optimized to control the flow of fluid using light. In this paper, the device components developed at the University of North Texas will be presented for the realization of a lab-on-a-chip. Â© 2011 SPIE.
