We have previously demonstrated a resonant microwave measurement technique optimised for highly accurate, nondestructive and label-free liquid-phase dielectric spectroscopy [1]. This was successfully integrated into a microfluidic platform [2] for in situ, non-invasive and real-time measurements. Here we report major enhancements in the microfluidic functionality in order to demonstrate the flexibility and usefulness of the measurement platform. We present some further results, discuss the enabling aspects of such an approach and consider the relevance to, and applications within, chemical and biochemical analysis. In hitherto unattempted experiments, single-phase concentration measurements of solvent-solvent and solute-solvent systems have been used to investigate limits of detection, whilst the suitability of this technique to multi-phase and digital microfluidic regimes have been demonstrated with segmented-flow measurements.
