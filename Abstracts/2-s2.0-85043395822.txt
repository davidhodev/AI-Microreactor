The effect of three-phase flow rate on the micro-droplet generation of double emulsion mechanism is available for reference to produce precise size and highly monodisperse particles. The influence of three-phase flow rate on the formation mode and size of the emulsion droplets is investigated by combination of experiment and numerical simulation. The size of compound droplets decreases and frequency increases with the increasing outer fluid flow rate. The monodispersity of the double emulsion reduces due to transition from dripping to narrowing jetting regime. Outer droplet size increases with the increasing flow rate of the middle fluid, whereas inner droplet size is the opposite. The frequency increases and then stabilizes, which leads to a widening regime. When Q2/Q1 > 6, the multi-core type double emulsion droplets are produced. Droplet coalescence occurs when surfactants is not involved. As Q1 increases, there is an increasing tendency for inner drop size. The outer drop size is proportional to the sum of the inner and middle flow rate, and that is irrelevant to Q1/Q2. For drop size, the ratio of core-shell and internal structure is precisely controlled by adjusting three-phase flow rate respectively.
