# AI-Microreactor
Laboratory-scale catalyst screening and characterization to broadly accelerate materials development and polymer commercialization. Uses artificially intelligent, autonomous microreactors (MicroAIRs) to address the technical challenges to better observe and analyze the catalyst process. I aided in the process of continually configuring the A.I and API to render the data in the smoothest and most efficient way possible. Led by Ryan Hartman PhD.
